The Lord is good and bountiful in blessings. Another LIGHT medical missionary training course started here in Asia. We had no idea what would transpire until we saw God opening the providential “doors” to finally make this happen, as we took a step of faith. There were 12 committed participants who joined coming from different provinces of the country. They left their posts of duty temporarily to learn more about the genuine medical missionary work and how to make it practical for themselves and others. In one occasion, after we already started the training, the money for food allowance of the participants was not yet met, and so we were praying for a miracle to come and that God will once again hear the prayers of His people.

A few days after, the confirmation came from a health director that they will be in charge of the amount needed. Praise the Lord! He never fails His beloved people. While the trainers were having a moment of devotion with our God one morning, we were impressed to brainstorm on how we can reach the communist community with medical missionary work, without violating any government policy, since we do not want our local church to be affected. At the same time, we asked God that He will prove to the participants that medical missionary work can break down prejudice, and can also be a way to meet and make friends with other people. What God showed us that morning is amazing. First, we noticed that this area is very much into music. Rock music, Buddhist music, and their popular folk songs. “Is there such a way that heavenly music can reach their hearts?”, we wondered. 










&#8220;Only fear the Lord, and serve him in truth with all your heart: for consider how great things he hath done for you&#8221;  

1 Samuel 12:24.










One of our companions is a great violin player and upon hearing the idea, he become very excited to play his instrument. At first it was very unusual for onlookers to see that there was beautiful music being played. There were chairs set-up, offering a free 5minute massage to anyone in need. After a while, people made their way towards the chairs to receive a rejuvenating massage. They were very happy! The cost of a massage, in some parts of Asia, is expensive but they received it here for free! We met some people who can speak English, some are businessmen, students, fathers, tourists from Europe, and there was even one evangelical pastor who came at the place because he heard heavenly music at the site! It was a privilege to share with him that Jesus is soon to come and we need to get ready and to let other people be ready as well! Of course, this was said with caution as I am figuring out whether this is a spy or a real pastor! Praise the Lord we were able to make good contacts that night.

The following morning, we told the group about our night adventure, and all of them were inspired. They said, “Let’s do it again”! We came back and had several missionaries with us. The publishing director was inspired by our testimony, so he went with us as well. He brought his supplies of books to sell to anyone who may be interested. Not long after, a policeman came, trying to stop us. Due to the lack of evidence that we were violating any government rules and principles, we were allowed to continue. This was a night to remember for the participants. Since then, they have not ceased conducting activities and services like this, in different locations. God inspired and moved the hearts of our brethren, and we pray that what God has started will be accomplish and will bring more people to the kingdom of God. Please continue to pray for this region. Also, please pray that the translation of our classes can be finished soon, and that the pastor we encountered can learn more on the principles of God&#8217;s Healing Program.
