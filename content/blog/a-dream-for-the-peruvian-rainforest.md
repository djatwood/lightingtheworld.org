Resting peacefully along a lagoon in the Peruvian rain forest, lies the beautiful campus of Peru Projects, which endeavors to reach out to the people of Peru with the message of salvation and better health. Their special focus is the nearly inaccessible tribal peoples and other ethnic groups spread across thousands of miles of dense rainforest and winding rivers. Since 1997, this ministry has faithfully served the region with medical aviation and the sponsorship and guidance of Bible workers. The Adventist church has worked hard to enter this challenging region, spearheaded in early years by the Stahls, and continued by many other faithful workers. However, at current count, of the 83 listed regions of the rainforest covered by the Eastern Peruvian Mission, 23 still lack any Adventist Presence, and 13 of these have no church close enough to reach out to them. How many of these regions must wait another generation to have the gospel carried to them?

To reach this need, a dream has slowly grown, and is soon to become a reality, that of a missionary training school, to prepare dedicated gospel and health evangelists who will enter this untouched territory for Christ—mingling with the people, showing interest in them, caring for their health needs, breaking down their prejudice and winning their confidence, and then pointing them to the Master Healer who will take away the ills of the soul, with the goal of preparing a people for the soon-coming of Jesus! The goal is to solidly train couples or teams and place them in 15 totally untouched regions within the next 3 years, with a goal of establishing solid congregations within 10+ of these regions within 4 years. These missionary trainees will not only receive health and gospel training, they will also develop their own mission plan and receive solid training in agriculture and a second skill so they can become self-sustaining. The missionaries will be guided and mentored by their teachers and a pastor who has been assigned specifically to this territory. God has provided quality leaders for the school, housing and a classroom, as well as abundant agricultural land on which food can be grown to help feed the students.

Perhaps you have dreamed of going as a missionary to one of these unreached, difficult to access regions of the planet. You can still go, or you can choose to send someone who already speaks one of the major tribal languages, knows the culture, and can thrive where a foreigner might easily become discouraged, sick, and fail—days from the nearest city, up a river or deep in the jungle. How can you help to make this a reality? $500.00 will cover the expenses of feeding, housing, and training one of these pioneer missionaries for 9 months, prior to their placement in the jungle, from which time, by God’s grace, and solid preparation, they will be self-supporting. $1000 will train a team for an untouched region. A commitment of just $50 per month for 10 months will also send someone with God’s message of love to those dying for many generations without Christ and without hope.

Will you let God use you to touch the people of the headwaters of the Amazon River for Christ?
