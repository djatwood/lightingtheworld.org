 As told by Samantha Subhash, LIGHT India










With prayer, we decided to approach the campus of Loyola college in hopes of conducting a health expo. We were able to meet with the main Father in charge who also happened to be the principle of the school. He had transferred there a few years earlier from the south of India where he was originally from. He was happy to meet fellow southern Indians and greeted us with much warmth and invitation. Upon hearing about our program, he was very quick to accept the health program to be conducted for his students. We set up an appointment and decided to come within the week.

The day of the health expo arrived, and due to a large number of students (a total of over 300) and our limited number of team members, we decided with the principle that it would be best to split them into two sessions. As the day went on, we again witnessed the lack of basic knowledge regarding health information concerning their bodies. For most of their consultation with doctors, I was repeatedly hearing that the doctor would tell them to simply drink more milk. As students and professors passed through my consultation table, they shared that this was such valuable, meaningful information for them. A few even stated that this was the most meaningful program they ever had in their school!

Because they understood the value of the information they received, they were ready to start changes in their lives. I was blessed to witness proof of this later on in the week when I went on a visit for a personal counseling session per request. The Lord amazingly led! One of the students had extremely low blood pressure, and due to loneliness from childhood, she was starting an inappropriate relationship with another female. She knew it was wrong and it was starting to cause her health to decline. In tears, she said that she understood the power of Christ, and she knew that she had to break off the relationship to be able to fully turn to Jesus instead! Praise the Lord!

After the Lord led yet another successful health expo, the principal invited us to come back the following whole week to lead their morning devotion for the entire staff and students—over 300 people. At the end of our time with this college, around 53 students and one Ph.D. professor signed up for Bible studies! But it doesn’t end there. The Lord has opened the door for future projects as well. The principle was so happy with the feedback from staff, students, and his own experience going through the health expo that he has invited us to work together when we come back again! Praise the Lord for allowing us to create new relationships as part of His plan to break down barriers and share the truth of the everlasting gospel!

This past month in Sikkim has opened our eyes to the great need in this place. We truly believe the Lord opened the doors for us to enter with the health message in hand to ultimately share the living gospel to this people group. Please join us in prayer that God send the right workers to this place and that our next visit there will go smoothly and according to His plan.
