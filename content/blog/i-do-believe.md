Earlier this year, in March, I received a call from the health director of the Seventh-Day Adventist Union in El Salvador. She shared the urgent need for health evangelism training as there has not been such training in that little country of Central America. One week later, I had a Skype meeting with the president and health director of the Union. They were very clear about the impact they wanted, not just for a little group of lay members, or a district of churches or a local conference, but rather a complete impact on the five conferences in the Union! The plan was to have a one week training seminar about nutrition coupled with a cooking school in each conference during the month of September. Interestingly enough, this course was especially organized for the following individuals: pastors and their wives, health and temperance leaders of the conference and churches, as well as cooks from the Adventist academies! At the end of a tiring but fulfilling and powerful five weeks, we trained over 350 persons with each receiving an apron at the end of the course! It was so refreshing to see church leaders taking the time to be equipped on topics like nutrition and also learning how to prepare over 40 simple and delicious vegan meals. 

Edwin is the director for one of the SDA academies in El Salvador. He attended the seminars with his wife, who practices a vegetarian lifestyle. Even though his wife has always been there as a strong support for him, Edwin told me it was always a very difficult thing for him not to eat lots of meat and dairy. When he heard about the course, he was hesitant at first, but felt a very strong impression from the Holy Spirit that he needed to attend. The first day impacted his life so much due to the scientific information shared that pertained to new studies on the role of nutrition and longevity factors. What’s even more exciting is that he sampled the variety of vegan recipes at the end of the day! He told me that very evening, “This is the best thing that could have  happened to me at this time”… At the end of one full week of seminars, Edwin was more than positive that this is the type of diet that’s best for his body and overall health. He now enjoys a vegan diet with his overjoyed wife, and over a week ago he told me, “Each time I sit at my table to eat, I always remember the faces of my instructors that taught me how to eat and live a healthy lifestyle.” He now leads his staff and students at the academy on the path to a healthier diet.
