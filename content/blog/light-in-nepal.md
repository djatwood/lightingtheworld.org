We are continuing on schedule here in Jante, Nepal. Emily and I divide time between teaching home school classes, and teaching classes at our little training center. Massage, Christian Home, and Christian Finance are the latest classes we&#8217;ve taught. The women are continuing in tailoring training, healthy cooking, and agriculture under the teaching of the other staff members. We personally appreciate the daily schedule, it helps us to know what to prepare for.

The ladies being trained here continue to amaze us! Many are growing leaps and bounds. To give you an example, our school days are very full as well as our dormitory rooms. We have them sleeping one to two to a bed, and up to seven women in a room. At night, after the classes of the day are finally finished, right before bedtime, they gather in their rooms to have group prayer together. Powerful! Sandra says there has been very little quarreling within this group. Truly an answer to prayer!

A Sabbath ago the students asked when they can go out and share their faith. Almost the entire group went out Sabbath afternoon to talk to people in the neighborhood about their state of health- body and soul.

Emily&#8217;s mom and aunt came last week, just before Sabbath, to visit us. It has been fun to have them here and share with them our daily lives. They brought us treats from America including a bright, solar-powered lantern to help us at night when electricity is not available. It has been nice to have little reminders of life in America.  

For instance, we don&#8217;t get oats here in Nepal. A spoonful of granola for the first time in a long time was so nice. We have all agreed that daily life is much different here in Nepal than in America. However, we realize it&#8217;s all worth it especially when we see the beautiful people here and how the students are growing in faith and skills!

May 17th our current training program finishes. Our staff here have already laid plans for an advanced women&#8217;s program for this summer monsoon season. It will train a select group of our current students to be tailoring teachers. They will have more theology, more tailoring, more mathematics, more prayer.  

We are placing all our plans at the Lord&#8217;s feet and moving forward in faith. As of right now our next six months women&#8217;s ministry course will begin in October 2016 with our little family of three living with the students and filling the directorship position of the program.  

We are reminded of&#8230;










&#8220;Only the work accomplished with much prayer, and sanctified by the merit of Christ, will in the end prove to have been efficient for good.&#8221;  

Desire of Ages pg. 362.2










May this be true of all our labors!  

Let&#8217;s all keep entreating God for richer measures of His grace! Please continue to keep us in prayer as we try to learn the Nepali language. Thank you for all your love and support!

In His care,  

Joshua, Emily, and Azaliah Jeresek
