At the beginning of this year, seventeen students enrolled and completed the program, which is [the six months LIGHT curriculum](http://lightingtheworld.org/training/). To God be glory and praise!  

We had students from the Caribbean and South America, namely, Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago, St. Lucia, Bolivia and of course, Guyana. Last year we even had students from Venezuela. God is truly blessing us here and many young people are answering the call to become medical missionaries.

It starts in January and ends in June. Immediately after the six months program, we offer an advanced massage program, two weeks in length, then a _Missionary In Training_ (MIT) program which goes for a month. During this program we introduce our young people ages 17- 22 years old to the missionary work with the intention that they will develop an interest in the mission field. Six of the seventeen students who completed this year’s six months program (LIGHT curriculum) were from last year’s MIT group.  

We are thankful that God continues to provide staff that are dedicated and have a wealth of knowledge and experience. This year we were happy to have an online LIGHT graduate from St. Lucia, join our staff.

From August to December we go to different churches and communities holding seminars, Bible studies and health expos. We encourage our graduates to join us (administrators) and participate in these activities; also to plan some activities of their own and invite us to participate.

Our school, Bethany Medical Missionary College (BMMC) has sixty (60) acres of land. We plant lots of vegetables and fruits, such as pine apples, on a small scale for campus use. However, as part of our strategic plan for self sustainability, we are extending our farming area. Our plans include growing Irish Potatoes, Apples that can be grown in the tropics, dehydrating and canning of fruits and vegetables.

We are thankful for the support we have been receiving from [Wild Wood] (http://www.wildwoodhealth.org/healthevangelism/)and trust that God will continue to guide as the field of labor expands. Our prayer is that God will send some dedicated and committed Medical Missionary men and women, who are willing to help us, for we cannot do it all.
