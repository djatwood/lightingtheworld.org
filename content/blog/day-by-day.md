I would like to thank God for this great opportunity to work for Him by being a witness for His kingdom.  

My friend, Saul, is a member of the Dharan Church. He had worked as a youth leader for many years and participated in various church events. Little did he know that his life would change forever. Here is his testimony:  

Early Monday morning, Saul rode his bicycle to his university. He had taken his usual route to get to his destination. Abruptly, a gigantic truck spun out of control on the road. In the midst of the chaos, it slammed into Saul and his bike. Then, the truck hit a tractor and immediately stopped.  

The onlookers of the scene gathered at the accident site. While they started asking questions, no one seemed to recognize who Saul was. Coming in and out of consciousness, Saul was able to remember my mobile number as an emergency contact. At the time, I was still sleeping when I received the dreadful call. In an instant I headed out the door to take my wounded friend to the hospital. Once admitted, the doctor checked him and found that his head was gashed, three of his ribs were broken and there were serious damages in his right lung.

Upon hearing the news, Saul’s family rushed to his side in despair. His condition was worsening and the doctors warned us that it would be incredibly difficult to save him. As he stayed there, lying in his hospital bed, I felt such sadness. I had known this man for so many years. His friendship was greatly appreciated. At this point, all I wanted for him was to get better. Once again, the doctor warned us that Saul had a very slim chance of healing. As soon as we heard that, Saul’s family and I started praying. Days passed, and Saul’s health was not improving. The team of doctors decided that, because of the severity of Saul’s injuries, he should go to a hospital that specializes in these medical emergencies. At first, we thought that Saul could be transferred to this hospital by ambulance, but the doctors knew that these next few hours of life were precious towards his recovery. Instead, they suggested to take him on a helicopter for quicker transportation. Unfortunately, Saul’s family did not have the adequate funds to meet this great need.

Again, we turned to God in prayer. We knew that there was nothing more we could do, but earnestly seek God’s will during this time of trouble.  

Amazingly enough, someone had heard about Saul’s situation and God convicted that person’s heart to pay for his medical expenses. We serve a GREAT God!  

A helicopter was urgently summoned to take Saul to the medical facility. Every one that knew of Saul’s condition said that he would not live. Even the hospital doctors said his lung injury was extremely critical. Despite all of this, we prayed for him continually. Day by day, we prayed and fasted for his final recovery. By the grace of God, Saul’s health started to improve! 










&#8220;And I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.  For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.&#8221;  

Matthew 11: 9-10.










From this major accident, many people got the chance to see the power of our God. Now, Saul is back at home for further recovery. He is considering taking a Bible Seminary course in the near future. Please pray that God may not only guide him, but also completely heal him to do His service.
