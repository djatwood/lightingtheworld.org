Dear Friends,

Time flew fast on that 3 week nightly medical missionary training at Iloilo City, this has been the first LIGHT school in Visayas area and we were able to graduate 26 individuals and plenty of them are the volunteers of HCBN group, some are church officers and Bible workers of the church. Aside from these graduates we also had 36  people from the jail who were given lectures on Abundant Living, How to Stop Smoking, and Vegetarian Cooking Demo.

The blessings of the Almighty God were poured out on that training. After all the lectures were heard the Bible workers are being prepared to do Revival meetings in different churches. We see how these people are so energetic in hastening and quickening the coming of the Lord.

Also, we have a very supportive family who owns a a certain land in Guimaras Island that is 20 minutes away from the city proper by pumpboat who is willing to donate 3 hectare land to be the site of another training center for medical missionaries in Visayas region, the Lord is linking His people together, and we just stand in amazement on how the Lord is doing all these things. We were able to visit the place and it is just like and very similar to the homebase at Nueva Era, it is 450 ft above sea level.

Aside from these projects, we are also looking for the establishment of another bakery and a vegetarian restaurant in this city, we have seen the brethren catching up the vision of propagating the third angels message, again we bring back all this glory and honor to our Almighty God. The prayers now is that the Lord will send more students for our 6months school so we can have more volunteers for the opening up of our different ministries all around the Philippines

Keep us up in your prayers, our next training will happen this month of April and May in two different location one is in Luzon and the other one in Mindanao.

servant for Christ&#8217;s sake,
