In August of 2018, the opportunity arose for a member of the Breath of Life SDA Church in Barbados to acquire 1,100 copies of the LIGHT book, “ADOPT A NEW HEALTH HABIT EVERY WEEK.”   As the book had a slight flaw, they were acquired free of cost.  It was a real challenge to transport the books to Barbados, but with encouragement and persistence, the books arrived sometime in early October.  

In Barbados, we have many challenges with non-communicable diseases and their risk factors, both among our adults and children. 25 staff members, including the principal and deputy principal, registered for the program!This was launched in the form of a health challenge.  

In October, a number of SDA doctors, senior nurses and medical missionaries arrived at the school early in the morning to setup and run a health clinic between 6:30 am and 7:55 am.  Each participant was tested as it is suggested in the book.  

The program started 1 week later and a sub-program was introduced as a support for this program, entitled “LUNCH TIME WITH THE DOCTOR”. Once a week, at lunchtime, an SDA health professional would present a lecture in the staff lunchroom on a health topic.  So far, we have had a Nutritionist who did “FOODS FOR BRAIN POWER”, and staff were able to sample healthy sunflower cheese during this session. Then we had a doctor, who did “CANCER FIGHTING FOODS” and staff brought vegetables and we prepared a very large raw salad and shared it. These sessions are well supported, even by staff who did not register for the program.  

A WhatsApp chat was set up as part of the endeavor where participants could support each other and post pictures of their meals.  Although this group is made up of mainly teachers, they are heavy meat and junk food eaters.  HOWEVER, within days, some lunch tables in the staff room were transformed as the colorful salads popped out of lunch boxes daily. People were now snacking on fruits.  

As individuals posted pictures of their breakfast, lunch and dinner, it was clear to see that this tiny little book “ADOPT A NEW HEALTH HABIT EVERY WEEK” had a huge impact.  People have begun losing weight and experimenting with foods that they have never tried before.  God is truly blessing.  The program is in its second week and as we move into the third week, two exercise sessions are being planned.  The teachers will now be wearing track pants and soft shoes for their post digestive walk after eating at lunch each day.  

The Personal Ministry Department of the Breath of Life SDA Church in Barbados has decided to pilot the book in one of its communities. This will be an evangelistic effort to see the impact it will have, before it is practiced in other areas.  The church has also been invited by the chief/head doctor of one of the government polyclinics to conduct a program there, using the book to an at-risk outpatient group. That program should start later this month. In order to impact other areas, we need more books and other resources in order to truly use the health message as the right arm of the gospel.
