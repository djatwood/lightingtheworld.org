*This is told in the perspective of Rodney, the North Asia Divisional Director

 Kazakhstan is the dominant nation of Central Asia with a population of 18 million people. This country is surrounded by Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kurdistan, Uzbekistan and Russia to the north. The story of “Pearl Health” goes back to 1993 in Ukraine where I first met Svetlana Alexichuk. She was attending our first Wildwood Medical Missionary School that was being conducted in her country. At the end of the short course, she was one of two students who was extended an invitation to come to the US for further study at the Wildwood Lifestyle Center (located in Wildwood, GA). Svetlana excelled in her studies and caught the vision for helping to start a similar health center in her home country.

After two years of training, she returned to Ukraine where she helped pioneer a new wellness center called “Our Home”. She served there as a therapist and health counselor for ten years. This is where she met her husband Dovlet, (from Turkmenistan), who came to Novi to receive medical missionary training. When the two of them eventually united their lives together in marriage, they answered the call from a church leader to come to Kazakhstan to be apart of the wellness center ministry. There was no facility, and no funds, but there was a great need. God led them to use what they had at hand. In just a few rooms loaned to them at the mission office in Almaty, (once the capital of the country), they began running live-in wellness programs. People from all backgrounds, including Muslims, began to come for help. After four years, 15 lifestyle sessions and many healing miracles, God provided a property in the country, nestled in the beauty of nature as a haven for those seeking aid.

After three years in the construction process, the team anticipated a dedication service for the end of June even though they lacked some funds for finishing the kitchen and hydrotherapy departments. One may ask, “Why rush the opening then?” The truth of the matter is that there are many people in this region who have a desperate need. With the success they had while operating in Almaty, word has spread throughout the country and people are constantly pressing the team to take them in for treatment. When the first official lifestyle session begins on July 15, all 25 beds will be full of patients, and a waiting list for their next session. Thank you for your prayers and financial help. Presently, the building is mostly completed and the patient rooms and nicely furnished. Nonetheless, there is still an urgent needed of $38,000 to finish equipping the kitchen and hydrotherapy department.
