Recently, our team participated in the &#8220;Healthy Family&#8221; project in Energodar, Ukraine.  

By God’s help, we started our professional upgrading program in the middle of June. We learned practical skills for: diseases and treatment of spinal problems, Nordic walking and curative gymnastics. We were a part of the production, marketing and logistics process in the health food store. We were instructed how to successfully organize a health room with hydrotherapy and massage treatments.  

Together with the Ukrainian team, we led the final meetings for the Health Club. During the last year, three people were baptized and a few more started visiting the worship services on Sabbath. Today they actively participate in missionary work.

Every Sabbath, we had the opportunity to share experiences with the church and encourage our brethren to actively engage in missionary work in the community. The inspired ones were trained on how to organize a health expo. Every Sunday, they were a part of our team for the health fairs we held.  

During the event, we talked about health with various individuals, while taking measurements and giving consultations.  

The participants of the health expo were invited to visit our health club. That is where we explained the causes of diseases and their natural remedies.  

Being a part of the &#8220;Healthy Family&#8221; project, we were encouraged by their sincere desire to hasten the advent of our Lord Jesus, using medical missionary work as the right hand of the gospel.
