God is doing a mighty work in the Bahamas! Shanniel Fisher, our LIGHT Director for the Inter-America Division, started his seminars the day after he arrived on the island. His flight arrived safely and he’s been eager to start teaching everywhere and anywhere he can. He spent two weeks presenting several topics to the people there. Some of the topics include: lifestyle diseases, nutrition, cooking schools, massage, hydrotherapy and much more! These topics are not widely discussed in this country. However, LIGHT was come to shed some light on these classes.  

God can use any medium to glorify His name.

By His grace, Shanniel has gotten the opportunity to go to a local Christian (non-Adventist) TV station to share the knowledge that God has given him to reach a broader audience than what he originally anticipated. This experience could only come from above.  

During the weekends, Shanniel has various churches that he visits to do health presentations in the area.

There are close to 50 people coming consistently each night to attend these presentations. Many of the people that are coming to learn more making healthy lifestyle changes are non-Adventists. We pray that theses individuals will be blessed through the work of health evangelism that is being done in this region.

Shanniel offers consultation sessions to those who would like counsel on nutrition, among other things. The non-Adventists individuals seem very interested on obtaining more knowledge of how they can live healthier lives. Continue to pray for the work that is being in the Bahamas.
