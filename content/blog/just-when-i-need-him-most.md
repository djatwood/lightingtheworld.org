Here is a report from one of our tailoring teachers that discusses how the Lord used him to fulfill a mighty work in his village.

Caleb went to Patan, his home village, for some personal work, and to meet some prospective Women’s Ministries or Seminary students.  When he went home, he met his niece, Rebecca. She had been a Christian before, but had married a Hindu man when she was young.  Later her husband went to a foreign country to earn money.  When she saw Caleb in her village, she asked if she could join the Women’s Ministry’s course.  He tried to discourage Rebecca in many ways not to go, because she liked to play and goof around.  Rebecca said, “No, I want to change.  I want to do better.  Give me one chance.”  

She kept pushing to go.  Finally, Caleb called another teacher, and the other teacher said, “Okay, if Rebecca wants to go so much, let her go”!  Caleb told her that she wouldn’t like the food, but she said she really wanted to go.  She wouldn’t be able to have her cell phone and play on it, but still Rebecca was persistent that she wanted to change.

So, Rebecca came and began the Women’s Ministry’s Course.  Things were going well for a few days. Suddenly, she was attacked by a demonic spirit.  Her teachers had no idea that she had been struggling with these forces.  As they talked to her family members, they heard that she had gone to a witch doctor to be freed from these spirits.  The witch doctor had told her that the only way to become free was to either become wholly Christian or completely Hindu.  While Rebecca was being attacked by these demonic powers, the staff took time for special prayer and fasting.  God heard their prayers and He delivered her. With encouragement, she was able to press forward.










&#8220;Be strong and of a good courage, fear not, nor be afraid of them: for the Lord thy God, he it is that doth go with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.&#8221;  

Deuteronomy 31:6.










One day, Rebecca got news that her husband, who was still in a foreign country, had run off with another woman.  Devastated, she wanted to return home, but her uncle (our tailoring teacher) encouraged her to stay, because going home would not solve her problems.  By God’s grace, she is doing better and is pressing forward with her studies here at the Center.  

We urge you to pray for our young ladies.  Several of them have been attacked by Satan and we need God’s protection during this time of affliction.
