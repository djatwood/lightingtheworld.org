We always had a life full of appointments, meetings and stress. Unfortunately, at that time our main concern was to earn money and gain better positions in the companies where we worked.  

We had a beautiful house, a very good car, great jobs and great salaries but unfortunately we lacked the time to take advantage of our things.










&#8220;We cannot remember when we sat on the sofa in our room to rest. We were always working, working, working, trying to make more money and then spend it on good restaurant, travel and then? Working more and more just to pay off the credit card. In the midst of all this stress, there was no time to take care of our health and we lost our focus on the most important points of our life: spirituality, family and health.&#8221;










In 2011, we participated in a Mission Medical school in Brazil and we were very blessed! Since then many things have started to change. It is as if God opened our eyes to see a new future, one that was happier and full of hope. We determined to radically change our lifestyle, step by step, we became healthier, we spent more time for each other and we changed the focus of our professions. With every change, every decision, God blessed us more and more. On May 29, 2014, God took us to a very special place: the &#8220;College of Health Evangelism&#8221; of Wildwood, Georgia.  

It was a blessing to participate in their health and missionary program.  

We stayed there for over a year and during this period we got to know Bill and his wife, Lois. From them we heard the testimony of their missionary project in India and we were strongly impressed to became a part of it.

During our 16 years of marriage, we had unfortunately not been able to have children due to health reasons. This had often made us feel sad, we still yearned to have children to teach them all the things we were learning and to carry on our legacy. Whenever I read Psalm 127, I was sad because I had no &#8220;arrows in my quiver&#8221;.  

But we believe that when God closes a door he opens several others.  

And that&#8217;s what happened!










&#8220;Children are a heritage from the Lord, offspring a reward from him. Like arrows in the hands of a warrior are children born in one&#8217;s youth. Blessed is the man whose quiver is full of them. They will not be put to shame when they contend with their opponents in court.&#8221;  

Psalm 127: 3-5.










About a tear before going to Wildwood, a friend had told us that God could give us spiritual children. The phrase &#8220;spiritual children&#8221; would not let me go.  

On February 7, 2016, we embarked on our trip to Calcutta and never imagined the gift that God had prepared for our lives. During the the 5 months and 2 days we were there, God gave us 51 spiritual children, 28 boys and 23 girls all at once. Our quiver was full. Overflowing! Now we have children of all ages, with different personalities and different colors. Each one is a treasure! It was the most special gift we were ever given!

This week, as we are writing this, we are getting ready to return to Calcutta in two weeks. We miss our dear spiritual children, but soon we will be together again. God is very good and always gives us much more than we ask.
