As told by Serghei, a LIGHT student in Ukraine










My name is Serghei and I am from Ukraine. More than 10 years ago, I was a drugs addicted person.

Since my wife was pregnant, I was using my money to find happiness, when true happiness was near. Bad company of so called friends were parting me from my family. But, in my heart, I was searching for God. My mother was destroyed when she understood that I was involved in a robbery. I was also trying to hide from my father, knowing his attitude toward drugged people. 

But one day, my mother met a SDA and she asked help. This sister advised her to take me to Kiev, to one specialist, that was helping people like me. I tried and it helped. This person was praying for me. At the end of my treatment, he told me: never try to think about sensations you had in the past. Don’t think to try it once more.

When I was following his counsel everything was well but I lost the battle and was in a critical situation and I went again to this specialist.  

Having a second chance for life I saw that my family needs me. I said that I don’t want to return to my old life anymore.  I asked the SDA pastor to arrange for me to be baptized. The pastor was helping me to know God. My wife saw these great changes that have taken place in my life  and one day she said to me: “ I want to be baptized also. This joy transformed our future family life. Soon my mother and father were baptized. We were wishing to do something for God but we don’t know what exactly God wants from us. But a year ago, We met Artiom and Olga at a Medical Missionary Conference in Kiew. They shared their experiences about the LIGHT program. We knew that this was the will of God, to serve people in need. 

Today, we are Light students in Ukraine. At the end of this course, we plan to open a family health center near Hmelnitk, Ukraine.
