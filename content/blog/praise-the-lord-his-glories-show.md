My name is Vicky and I live in Kenya. One day as I watching TV I came across a program called Medical Missionary, which drew my interest in the connection between health and the Word of God. Over a period of 1 year I kept a date with the program; Saturdays 8:00pm it was.

In my curiosity and desire to learn more I decided to go to the internet (as you know everything on google is true, right?) and search medical missionary. Various options came up but I needed one closest to my location and in one of those searches LIGHT-Kenya came up and I made contact. I was given the options of studies available and since I am engaged in full time employment, home study was the most appropriate so I enrolled. As I studied my manuals I discovered that dairy causes bloatedness, something I had struggled with for years! In fact, I used to sleep with my hand supporting my stomach due to the discomfort, but I can tell you I used to take a lot of dairy milk in all its forms; fresh milk, flavored milk, yogurt in all its flavors, curd, cream, name it I used (by the way it runs in the family….hehehe we are all kittens) I decided to stop taking dairy milk for 3 days and see if I could experience any changes and sure I did. Bloatedness and belching stopped I was feeling fine.










&#8220;Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the Word of truth&#8221;  

2 Tim 2:15.

However, I didn’t believe that was the reason, I went back to my milk and immediately the bloating started. I had finally proved a point to myself and the dairy milk had to go from my shopping list and in came an alternative. I got cashew nuts which is equally yummy milk. Another out of the list was sugar. These two dietary changes have caused me to shed off some weight and now I look and feel healthier. Not only have I achieved physical benefits but also spiritual as everything that is learned has its root in the Word of God relevant to today’s life. Thank you LIGHT- Kenya for accommodating my unique requirements in order to gain knowledge am now quipped to teach others. My colleagues think I should be transferred to our health department to advocate for healthy lifestyle. In the meantime, studies continue.
