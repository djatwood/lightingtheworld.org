 A story by Rachel Nina










I am Raquel Nina. In spite of the obstacles and barriers that arose in life, I decided, with the blessing of God, to participate in the LIGHT course at the Lifestyle Center and LIGHT affiliate Los Aromos Wellness Center located in Chillán, Chile. It was an experience that marked my life physically, mentally and spiritually. Many times we think that we know how to manage our life, and that as long as there is not much pain or suffering, everything will be fine. We think that we should enjoy life and sometimes even sacrifice our physical and spiritual health. We forget that sooner or later all careless actions will bring difficult consequences along with pain and suffering to our lives. Many times, all the money we have cannot give us back the wellbeing that we lost and need.

Participating in the course was certainly more than an investment; it was a gain for my life. I am infinitely grateful to God, our dear sister Linda Bentancurt, Ilse, the director of the lifestyle center, and to all my missionary professors who, with much love, patience and wisdom, taught us theoretical and practical knowledge in the different courses of Anatomy, Physiology, Massage, Hydrotherapy, Healthy Cooking, Christian Living, Vegetable Gardening, Natural Treatments, Prophecy and Biblical subjects. Having received this training is one of the jewels that God brought into my life for which I will be infinitely grateful. At the beginning I took the course because I was interested in taking care of my health, being more in touch with God, and disconnecting for a while from the working world. I wanted to live in a quiet place in the middle of nature where you can breathe the pure air, rest without anything that interrupts your dreams, and be renewed every day to continue learning about the great love of God and the purpose for which we exist in this world. I don&#8217;t believe in chance. I know that everything has a purpose and God is showing it to me.  

After finishing the course, I returned home to teach my family everything I had learned. Today, I am with the OYIM (One Year in Mission) Missionary Project in the city of Santiago, Chile. Here, we work together with other missionaries in the Life Hope Center. It is a meeting place where we provide free workshops to the community such as Cooking Classes, Baking, Massages, Crafts, Biblical Studies, Natural Remedies, Computing, and more. I am very happy to see the enthusiasm and perseverance of our students, that despite being tired after work, come to the classes because it is a place that is more than a learning workshop. Here we can relate, share unforgettable moments, support each other, pray for each other’s needs and afflictions, visit people, and together, seek to learn more about God and His love for us, so that they can give glory to the One to whom our life, talents, and time belongs.
