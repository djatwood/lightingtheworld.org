Dirma took the one month course at the beginning of this year in Chile. Half a year later, she shared how her life had changed-for the better.

Her normal diet consisted of sweets, cheese, crackers, and cakes for the most part. She had high blood pressure, and her triglycerides as well as her cholesterol levels were high. She didn&#8217;t think she had any reason to be depressed, but her psychiatrist put her on medications for depression after some tests. The doctor would even tell her &#8220;Dirma, you need to change your diet because like this you will never get better.&#8221; She would respond &#8220;yes&#8221; but never got around to making any changes. She heard during a health talk that it was good to eat fruit, so she started adding fruit to her diet, but she felt a lack of energy and strength, and just continued with her lifestyle of eating sweets to avoid cooking, and continuing in this depressing state. Then the training group arrived at her church. They explained everything in greater detail, the reasons why we should eat more healthy, and what you can eat in order to live more healthy. So she decided to change her eating habits. She started to drink water, replace sweets with granola, then drink something like tea or another liquid an hour after her meal. In the afternoon, she went replacing her cheese and crackers with other healthier alternatives as well. It was then that she started to feel different. She had more energy, she felt like going on walks, she felt like doing things. She was experiencing the benefits of a healthier lifestyle.

After about 1 1/2 months, she went to her doctor for a check-up, and the doctor congratulated her because whatever she was doing was helping a lot. Then the doctor asked what she did, and our friend then had the opportunity to tell her the story about the program at her church, the health talks, and the change in diet.

Before, her mind was clouded, and she didn&#8217;t feel like reading the Bible. She didn&#8217;t feel like doing anything for that matter, just go home, watch tv, and head to bed for the night. But after changing her diet, she started to get up earlier and get to bed earlier. She stopped watching TV, started exercising, and making many other changed in her lifestyle. She started living the abundant life that God designed for every one of us. And this whole cascade of changes and improvements in her life started with what went into her mouth&#8230;
