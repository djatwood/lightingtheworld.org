*This is told in the perspective of Shanniel Fisher, LIGHT’s Inter-America Divisional Director.









It is the smallest country in Central America, with a very eager bunch of church members that want to do health evangelism. Last year in September, LIGHT was invited to do a nutrition and cooking seminar. At the end of the seminar, over 365 members were trained. Since that time, the El Salvador Union has been filled with a zeal to share God’s love through the principles of health. LIGHT received a second invitation in January 2019 to do another union training, with an emphasis on health expos. A total of 174 members received the training. Each student established goals of executing various expos in multiple communities. With 5 conferences that were involved in the training, 3 of those conferences have done health expos. 1,097 people were benefited from these activities. The other two conferences that have not yet done expos are scheduled to do 2 of them by the end of March, 2019. The El Salvador Union is on fire for Jesus!

The Carribean island of Jamaica is very active in Evangelism. 1 in every 10 Jamaicans are Seventh-Day Adventists! This dynamic, yet small Island is a force to be reckoned with as it relates to Evangelism. The Central Adventist Conference invited us to do a LIGHT 1-Month Training in April of last year. Since that time, the 80 graduates from that training have been busy every month with weekly health seminars, health expos, 5k runs, health evangelistic series &#038; much more. Over the past three months, the trained team has completed over 7 health expos. These events have impacted over 800 people in many of the local communities. There is another amazing impact that the Seventh-Day Adventist church has made in the Island… The Jamaican government has decided to stop serving sugary drinks in their schools and is now partnering with the Jamaica Union of Seventh-day Adventist Health Department. Together, they plan to launch a special program for the entire Island with the title: “Jamaica Moves”. This program will promote a healthy lifestyle with great emphasis on nutrition, exercise, water and many other simple lifestyle practices. As a result of our LIGHT training in Jamaica, church members, individuals in the community and government officials have been positively impacted.

Natural remedies can be quite simple, but their effects on the human body are tremendous! A LIGHT health seminar was held in Panama several weeks ago. One of the attendees listened carefully, especially to the presentations on “Simple Home Remedies”. Interestingly enough, her grandson was suffering from diarrhea, vomiting and lots of abdominal pain. He eventually went to the emergency room and received medication for his symptoms, but the little boy continued suffering with the symptoms mentioned above. The grandmother decided to apply simple remedies she had learned in the seminar. Miraculously, the boy felt better hours after charcoal was administered. Clay poultices was placed over his abdomen as well, and overall at the end of that day, he was relieved from his pain. Praise God for His simple methods and His healing touch! God is raising up His children all across this region of Inter-America to finish the work.
