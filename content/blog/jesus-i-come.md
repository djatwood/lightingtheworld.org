Josephine is a member of the Mennonite Church. She is also one of our community members. As a gesture of kindness, two students named Agnes and Deng, made an effort to visit her regularly. 

At first, Josephine was unwelcoming and indifferent towards Agnes and Deng. Eventually, she finally consented that Agnes and Deng could pray with her. The two students asked if there was something specific that Josephine had wanted them to pray for. Upon asking for this request, Josephine became very emotional and began to cry. She poured her heart out to Agnes and Deng requesting prayer for her son, Barack, who is married to woman who drinks and does not go to church.

Agnes and Deng prayed with her there and continued to visit Josephine. During each visit, they would often pray for her son Barack and his marriage.  After a few weeks, Josephine reported that Barack has made a decision to go to church. She has also noticed a change in his behavior.  Josephine is very happy, and she wants her local LIGHT affiliate school to come to her home for a time of fellowship to share what God has done for her son. Agnes and Deng, as well as other students and staff, are realizing that by following Christ’s method, souls can be won for the Kingdom.
