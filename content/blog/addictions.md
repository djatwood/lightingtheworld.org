It had been one of the harder weeks of Jane’s life; but now it was all behind her, and she knew it was time to celebrate. As Jane heartily dug into the chocolate sundae, she found it hard to believe how far she had come in just seven days. No ice cream for a whole week! And the results were impressive—her weight was down a full three pounds. As Jane savored each bite of her reward, she had the additional satisfaction of sensing she was finally on a path that would rid her of those 45 extra pounds. Yes, she thought, this was clearly doable. She would simply deny herself of ice cream all week long, then reward herself with a sundae every Sunday.

If you were Jane’s best friend would you join her celebration? Had Jane really come up with a winning weight-loss strategy? Or was she actually setting herself up for disappointment?

Unfortunately, if she is like most of us, Jane’s victory will be short-lived. For, in most cases, merely “cutting back” on how frequently you engage in a bad habit will not yield lasting success. This is particularly true if there is an addictive component to the behavior. Simply put, a daily habit of excessive ice cream consumption is not likely to yield to a routine of periodic abstinence.

Instead, the real power in behavior change lies in making clean breaks with destructive habits. Indeed, when you decide to call it quits, you unleash an amazing amount of mental resolve.

This is not news to substance abusers. They know that any success in their recovery was due to making a clean break with the alcohol or other drugs that enslaved them. However, most of us think we’re different. We don’t realize that our overeating of certain foods, our penchant for inactivity, or our affinity for caffeinated beverages often have addictive aspects that keep us imprisoned.

Look at it another way. If Jane decided that she was going to “file for a divorce” from ice cream, if she decided the relationship was over for good, then on a mental level she would free herself to develop new enjoyments. However, as long as she has a weekly tryst with ice cream she will be kept in emotional bondage.

Does the romantic comparison seem too strong? I think not. Consider this: aren’t your bad habits much like abusive relationships? Such “friendships” promise so much but ultimately only destroy you. In this context, when you see the consequences of a bad lifestyle habit (whether it be inactivity, depriving yourself of sleep, poor dietary choices, or any one of a hundred other problems), you talk yourself into believing that the consequences won’t keep coming; but they do. Your weight, for example, continues, ever so gradually, to follow its apparently inexorable rise. Or your diabetes remains out of control. Or your high blood pressure fails to yield despite the gradual increase of antihypertensive medications.

Can you relate to this cycle of freedom and bondage? If so, I would recommend to you the power of the clean break. Consider which habits are pulling you down, and determine to weed (rather than wean) those behaviors out of your life. Opt for a divorce rather than periods of separation.

Does this sound like too big an order to fill? Does your will seem too weak to make such a dramatic change? In my experience, most of my patients underestimate the power of choice resident within them. In fact, assessments of weak wills are often due to lack of resolute choices. If you merely make a half-hearted decision, don’t expect to harness any great amount of will power.

One of my favorite authors, E.G. White, crystallized this when she wrote in The Ministry of Healing: “What you need to understand is the true force of the will. This is the governing power in the nature of man, the power of decision, or of choice. Everything depends on the right action of the will.”

Some may wonder, isn’t deciding to make a clean break with sometimes delightful (albeit destructive) behaviors or habits going to set us up for a miserable existence?

Quite to the contrary. Scientific research reveals that when we make clean breaks, we tend to develop new enjoyments. Although hard at first, the clean-break method frees you to distance yourself mentally from those old behaviors. When you totally separate from high-salt foods, you generally develop a distaste for salty fare. When you say good-bye to those high-fat options, you’ll typically soon find unpalatable those fat-laden foods you once enjoyed.

When Jane makes a clean break with her ice cream, when the divorce is final, everything changes. No longer does she think longingly of the ice cream waiting for her. Instead of the warm, loving thoughts about the sundae, she is now free to perceive it as something destructive. She can cultivate cool, distancing thoughts as she reminds herself how those frozen desserts were contributing to her destructive diabetes, obesity, and high blood pressure, which are now improving.

This is not science fiction; this is medical research. I’ve seen it played out in hundreds of lives over my medical career. This is not someone else’s story; it’s mine as well. For, years ago, I made a clean break with my sugarladen “friends.” I now prefer the natural sweetness of fresh fruits to the chocolates and ice creams of my past. With unhealthful desserts, I guess you could call me, thankfully, a “divorcee.”
