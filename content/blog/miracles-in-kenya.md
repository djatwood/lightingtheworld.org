As told by Pastor Leon Curfs, East Africa Regional Director










July and August are very special months in Kenya.  These are the months that we have camp meetings. Irene and myself were called by the president of the North-Western Kenya Conference to be speakers at the Kesegon and Makunga SDA Camp meetings in Western Kenya.

The Kesegon camp meeting was well attended with around 750 church members on the closing Sabbath. After Irene presented on health, an elderly brother approached her and said that he was very happy and impressed with the presentation. He learned from Irene about the LIGHT school he offered to donate a piece of land to LIGHT to start a health school on it.  The district pastor is now following up on this offer of land to make it official.  We learned once again that God’s ways are beyond comprehension.

After Kesegon we travelled to the next camp meeting held at Makunga SDA Church. It was the first time Makunga SDA Church held a camp meeting and it was well-attended. On the closing Sabbath there were more than 1500 people present.  The Lord kept the rains back until the sermon was over and then within half an hour, the rain poured down.

When a call was made to bring offerings in money or in kind, we were very surprised. Next to the expected chickens, maize and beans, somebody brought a fridge and another a cow. This shows the love people have for their Lord.  The camp meeting ended with 15 people accepting the Lord Jesus as their Saviour and joining baptismal classes.

Indeed, the 2019 camp meeting season in Western Kenya was a blessed experience. A total of 28 people were baptized and 50 people joined the baptismal class in preparation for baptism.  LIGHT received an offer of a piece of land and an invitation to conduct Medical Missionary training in Kapenguria. We praise the Lord for His blessing and we ask you kindly to keep the work of the Lord here in east Africa in your prayers.
