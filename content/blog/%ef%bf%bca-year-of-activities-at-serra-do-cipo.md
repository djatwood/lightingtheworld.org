Serra do Cipó’s first year was full of God’s blessings. After months of planning, we started our first one-month missionary school last July. In September we had a weekend program for families “Alcançando Corações,” And in October we held two health programs. God provided the students, teachers, and volunteers that we needed. Then in November we welcomed our second class of mission school students at Serra do Cipó.

As always, we prepared much and prayed much that God would choose the students. Having realized the impact that this missionary course was having on families, we saw the need to make a special program available for families with children. Three families arrived with a total of 5 children ages 2 – 8. The addition of kids on campus brought about a new set of challenges, but the Lord blessed our efforts. One of the mothers told us that she was taking home a completely different child: now calmer and more easy going due to the influence of a natural atmosphere, a healthy diet and regularity.

Henrique and Hillary came to the mission school thinking it was a drug recovery program. When they realized it wasn’t, they were led by the Holy Spirit to accept God’s calling to remain as students. Within the first few days, they began to feel the benefits of the program. We were still able to offer them some special hydrotherapy treatments. And they partook of personal counseling sessions and bible studies all of which helped them overcome their addiction and make a decision for baptism.

But the youth were not the only

Many of our student with personal health problems. We had to be firm, explaining that the course had an educational objective and not a therapeutic one. At the end of the course one particular student’s experience gave testimony of the great health benefits she received by adhering to a healthy lifestyle. Her joint pain went away, her blood pressure was now normalized, and as a bonus also lost weight. We witnessed many miracles during the past month, but the greatest of them for us as volunteers was watching the Word of God break hearts that were hardened and insensitive. People who had been aware of the truths regarding the health message were now saying “I accept this divine plan for my life!”

Although we are very thankful for the opportunity to minister through the health programs and mission school we also feel the need to reach out to our local community. Our hearts also burn for them and for them we have prayed and labored. During this first year, we have conducted two health fairs in nearby communities reaching close to 300 souls. These events have aroused much interest in bible studies. In São Jose de Almeida the vice-mayor asked us to do follow up work with community health programs at least once a month. And in the town closest to us, São Jose da Serra, we are holding a weekly health club meetings where the local people receive short informative talks on health and practical demonstrations of a nutritious recipe or natural treatment.

We have started doing Bible studies with some people, but despite our efforts we haven&#8217;t been able to study with everyone who has showed interest or to act upon the mayor’s invitation at São Jose da Almeida. We would really like to have dedicated bible workers who be able respond to the present opportunities that have arisen and future ones that are sure to arise. We are hoping to rent a nearby locale to housing the bible workers and if you would like to send monthly donations to help with rent or other expenses please contact us.

Recent occurrences have given us many reasons to thank the Lord and praise Him. Up to a few weeks ago we had been holding Sabbath church service at the lifestyle center. We could have continued worshiping comfortably on our campus, but in the desire to follow the Master’s footsteps of reaching others for eternity, we started looking for an alternative. The Lord opened the way and touched the heart of a local merchant who accepted our request to rent his pizza restaurant. Halfway through November, during the middle of the missionary school, we begun our first worship service in our local village, São Jose da Serra. With some rearranging we now have a large enough venue that is conducive to worship. Some community members have already started attending and are showing much interest.

We invite you to rejoice with us as we consider all that God has done. And as we look forward to all that He has in store for us we trust He’ll be faithful to His promises. Join us as we pray for God to send workers and provide the means for His work. Unite with us as we ask for God to bless all those who have been touched by His Divine hand. Plead with us that many may be led and reunited in heaven as the result of this little piece of heaven on earth.

As numerous as the blessings received are so are the challenges that help us grow. We ask God to help us as we hold our third medical missionary school this coming January 2016. One of the challenge we face is our food service department. Our kitchen is still in need of cabinets, a range hood, food prep island, and an industrial fridge to facilitate serving the large number of students and volunteers who come during the mission school. And we hope to have an appropriate environment for cooking demonstrations. The estimated total costs for bringing the kitchen up to speed is US$4,000 which would make a tremendous difference in our ability to better serve and educate.

May this new year be filled with the blessing the Lord desires to send upon you and with the blessing He desires you to be.

In Christ’s love,  

The Team at Serra do Cipó!
