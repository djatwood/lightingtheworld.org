Throughout the ages, God has always had a people who were willing to stand for Him. Many of the Lord’s true believers have died due to their beliefs and ultimately became martyrs for His cause. We’ve seen it in the story of Stephen and in the plight of the reformers. Although these instances have happened many years ago, martyrdom is still happening in various parts of the world.  

Christians are being persecuted for their Christian beliefs in parts of Southern Asia. Many people have had their voices hushed by death for defending the God of the Universe. Although it’s quite saddening, the Christian movement has been spreading.  Despite the affliction, Adventists are called to “finish the work”.  

LIGHT has conducted several courses and currently has several affiliate schools in these regions. Many people who are not Adventist are hearing about Christ through health evangelism. As they learn about these topics, the love of God is flawlessly intertwined to reach the hearts of the people. God is doing a mighty work with these trainings. Several Muslims, Hindus and Buddhists have declared that they’ve seem positive differences between the world and the people of the Adventist faith (Romans 12:2). 










&#8220;And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.&#8221;  

Romans 12:2.










Please keep praying for LIGHT as we continue to reach souls seeking for truth. God has opened many opportunities, however, there is more to be done. Martyrs may continue, but we have hope that this will one day come to an end. Christ WILL BE VICTORIOUS. Amen.
