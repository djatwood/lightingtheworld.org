*This is told in the perspective of Serghei Costash, LIGHT’s European Divisional Director.










A few months ago, our students were invited to visit a sick woman with their local pastor. She was paralyzed 8 years ago, after she fell down from a fig tree, in Abkhazia. The group that visited her saw a need to perform some hydrotherapy and massage treatments they learned during their health evangelism training course. The sick woman came to our center for treatment. The students became her therapists. Their care and love opened her heart for spiritual healing. We are thankful to report that this woman became a baptized member of the Seventh-day Adventist Church on April 25, 2019.

After the baptism, she became a very active medical missionary. She started counseling her neighbors with medical problems, in the remedies that she learned from us. In a short time, because of her witnessing we were able to offer medical advice for three couples. It’s such a joy to serve the Lord while teaching others about His message of love and healing.
