[“Want To Quit Smoking? Eat Your Veggies” — CBSNews.com:](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/want-to-quit-smoking-eat-your-veggies/)

“A Duke University study shows that fruits, vegetables…make cigarettes taste terrible. But meat, coffee, and alcoholic beverages make smoking much tastier, find Duke University psychologist F. Joseph McClernon, Ph.D., and colleagues…

“To study the issue, he [Dr. McClernon] asked 209 smokers to list foods that worsened or enhanced the smoking experience. The smokers averaged a little better than a pack of cigarettes a day for an average 21 years.”

“Nearly 70 percent of the smokers said some foods made their cigarettes taste better. These foods tended to be caffeinated beverages, alcoholic beverages, and meat…”

“Just under half of the smokers — 45 percent — said some foods made their cigarettes taste worse. These foods tended to be fruits and vegetables, non caffeinated beverages such as water and juice…”

“UB study finds that smokers who consume plenty of fruits and vegetables are three times more likely to quit”

“The authors, from UB’s School of Public Health and Health Professions, surveyed 1,000 smokers aged 25 and older from around the country, using random-digit dialing telephone interviews. They followed up with the respondents fourteen months later, asking them if they had abstained from tobacco use during the previous month…”

“The UB study found that smokers who consumed the most fruit and vegetables were three times more likely to be tobacco-free for at least 30 days at follow-up 14 months later than those consuming the lowest amount of fruits and vegetables. These findings persisted even when adjustments were made to take into account age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, household income and health orientation.

They also found that smokers with higher fruit and vegetable consumption smoked fewer cigarettes per day, waited longer to smoke their first cigarette of the day and scored lower on a common test of nicotine dependence.”

A Testimony of a Smoker From The Classic Book, Abundant Health:“If there was one thing in life I fear my will was too weak to conquer, it was the habit of smoking. Well, I have been a vegetarian for eight weeks and I find that my passion for tobacco is weakening. I cannot smoke those pipes now. I have to get new pipes and milder tobacco, and am not smoking half an ounce a day. It does not taste the same.”

“Researchers with the Netherlands Cohort Study followed 62,573 women and 58,279 men, aged 55 to 69, for more than six years, tracking the types and amounts of food eaten. The more fruits and vegetables the participants consumed, the lower their incidence of lung cancer.”

[“Phytoestrogens May Reduce Risk of Lung Cancer” — The Physician’s Committee of Responsible Medicine:](https://www.pcrm.org/health/cancer-resources/diet-cancer/type/lung-cancer)

“A new study at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center shows that natural compounds in beans and vegetables may reduce the risk of lung cancer. Phytoestrogens (phyto means plant) are structurally similar to estrogen hormones, but are much weaker. They occur naturally in many plants and, because they compete with the body’s natural estrogens to attach to estrogen receptors, they tend to reduce estrogen’s effects, thus reducing cancer risk.

Researchers compared 1,674 lung cancer patients with 1,735 healthy individuals and concluded that those who consumed the most phytoestrogens had a 46 percent less chance of getting lung cancer. Previous studies have shown that phytoestrogens may also reduce the risk of cancers of the breast, uterus, and prostate.
