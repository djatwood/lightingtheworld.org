 As told by Angie Sanchez, MD, LIGHT Representative, Peru










The Lord is opening doors in Peru, and we are so happy to see how God’s is allowing more LIGHT courses to take place make a great impact on our churches and in people’s lives.  In October 2019, we conducted a one month LIGHT course in Trujillo city which is in the north of Peru. For the first time in Peru, we had 106 graduates with many precious experiences and testimonies. Among our students we had 4 pastors and 5 pastor’s wives.

We met a ninety-year-old student named Bonifacio who never lost a class in our course. He is from Trujillo and had to quit primary school as a child so that he could help his family in the countryside. He worked as a farmer to support his family and also liked to tailor clothing for himself, his family, and his neighbors. He said he always tried to find ways to learn about how to maintain a good quality life.  Without knowing how to read or write, he came to this LIGHT course in Trujillo “Because,” he said, “I want to learn how to live a longer life and take care of my body because I know God is giving me the blessing to live so far, and I consider myself an eternal learner.”  

During this month, Bonifacio attended the classes by hearing the word of God and what the teachers taught about the principles of health according to the Spirit of Prophecy. “I felt very blessed with this course, and I will teach my daughter about the hydrotherapy classes I had and how to apply them”. At the end of the course, Bonifacio shared what he had learned with the rest of the students who saw him as an example of perseverance.  

We praise the Lord for bringing each person to our LIGHT training and for allowing us to share with many people who eagerly partook in every class and for giving us the opportunity to see hope for every student.
