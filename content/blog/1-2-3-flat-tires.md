The actual truck in this story



On one particular sabbath morning we got up to go to church, but when we went outside to load our pickup, we found the front, right tire was flat. No big deal, we just pumped up the tire with air and began our journey out to town with the group assigned to help at the church that day. But about halfway through the 11 mile drive, we had another flat tire, this time being on the left, rear side of the vehicle. So we changed that one and got back on the road. After this second flat, about 5 minutes later we were driving along at around 30-35 m/h when we heard a “boomp.” I looked out the window and saw a tire flying off the road, and I instinctively knew that it had to be ours. I have never had that happen before. We therefore stopped the car and went to check. Sure enough, the tire had flown off the car.

Pickup stopped on the side of the road with the second flat tire.








Interestingly enough, we had six people in the cab with 7 or 8 more people in the bed of the truck. A lot of the times those riding in the back will sit on the sides of the truck, since there isn’t much space to sit down in the bed of the truck, but for some reason just before the tire flew off the truck, they all decided to sit down on the floor of the bed instead of on the sides, then  right after that the tire flew off the wheel. With three flat tires there must have been some reason the devil didn’t want us to get to church that day, but praise God nothing happened to the front, left tire, and despite all the tire trouble we were still able to arrive during sabbath school.  

At times the Devil tries to discourage us and make us give up, or prevent us from accomplishing what God wants us to accomplish. But lets not let him discourage us from doing what God wants us to do, shall we?
