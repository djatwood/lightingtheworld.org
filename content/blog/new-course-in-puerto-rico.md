Just over this past weekend, the one month course in Puerto Rico has launched. With 43 eager students, the course is off to a good start, with cooking classes already on Sunday. And that is just the start! LIGHT will continue to train people in Puerto Rico next month as well with a full 1 month course as we continue to train more health evangelists to work in his vineyard!

Puerto Rico is a country LIGHT has been increasingly involved in over the past several month, with hopes to raise awareness of the true nature of medical missionary work and to eventually start a training school that will enable the church members to serve their community through health and win people to Christ.
