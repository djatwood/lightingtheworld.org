We just finished the second day of Health Expo. This time we walked to another village called &#8220;Neuf&#8221; (it means that it lays 9 km from Kisangani). We should have gone to another village (Quinze) but it laid too far from where we are. So we stopped at Neuf and the students quickly set up their banners (they are getting pretty good at it!). Yesterday at village Huit we had more than 45 people around; this time we had about 20. The students did a very good job &#8211; even the pastor was amazed at how they presented the information they have learned. At the end of the part on &#8220;Trust in God&#8221;, the pastor went up and started talking about the Lord and then he asked whether the people in the village wanted to study the Word of God.

One man stood up and said: &#8220;You just presented some good information to us.We know how important God is both to rich and to poor people. Now just tell us your time and we will be here for the Bible studies.&#8221; Then a very old man started talking about another &#8220;god&#8221;. We learned that we were in the mission place of a man who, in the 1960s, took himself for God and had people worship him (this is pretty common here in the Congo. The people know so few about God that anybody coming can fool them). He had two sons and he had them called the son and the holy spirit. So some of the people there were still in this trend and the very old man definitely. The man who had spoken earlier about having Bible studies interrupted the old man and said: &#8220;These people came from far away to bring these useful information to us. We will not let you take the time; (and turning to us) now just let us know when you are coming to study the Bible with us.&#8221; We were so amazed and happy (one of the students was translating for me).We will start the Bible studies this Sunday and at the same time start building the church in village Huit. It is so exciting.

When we came back we all went in the classroom singing and spent some time in prayer for the people, for us to be ready to study with them and for the evangelistic series starting February 6 (we will hold two of them).

Ps. 68:19  

Have a blessed Sabbath and continue praying for our work here in the Congo River Basin.
