Since March this year I have been studying with Pastor Edward a Pastor of the &#8220;Evangelical Church of Christ&#8221; here in Abuja. I had the privilege of preaching in his church for 4 consecutive Sundays  which is a rare opportunity for an SDA in a Sunday keeping church here in Nigeria. I left him with DVD materials and books to continue studying and the progress has been very remarkable, he and his wife attended a couple of my evangelism series last month and he is already asking for where he can get a further training join in the mission of the SDA church. He is also interested in our Medical missionary training. He has shown great interest in the health reform and has gone a step further in adopting some of the health practices.         Pastor Edward was a devout Catholic who latter join Pentecostalism in search of truth but was not satisfied, after joining the evangelicals he still had questions but he now feels his questions have been answered by the teachings of the SDAs.
