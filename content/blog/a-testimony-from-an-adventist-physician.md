Not too long ago we did a training at the Adventist Clinic in Chile. The following testimony came from one of the graduates:

I was baptized when I was 20 years old, and ever since then have always had the desire to serve God. With that vision, I soon began my university studies in medicine. After graduating as a physician, I have been blessed to work with the church. Time has passed quickly, and I do not have the youth that I once had. I am nearing retirement age now, and my wife and I wondered what we would do after retiring. But now we know what we will do. It was a nice surprise to see that there are ministries that work in support of the mission of the church. Now that I have a better understanding of the work of supporting ministries, and I plan after retirement on helping a supporting ministry with my presence whether it be LIGHT, OCI, the church, or another that shares this vision.
