We praise God for His many blessings! LIGHT has helped to develop lifestyle centers, vegetarian restaurants and other health ministries that will serve as lights to the community and offer outlets of service for graduate students. With our growing network of medical missionaries in over 80 countries, we can use health evangelism to finish the work! With that being said, another lifestyle center has been opened in Santa Cruz, Bolivia! The name given to this place is “Centro de Estilo de Vida Quebrada León”. It is located in a beautiful location, surrounded by God’s natural beauty. Being away from the hustle and bustle of city life really allows individuals to spend time with God while partaking in His creation.

Speaking of cooking, this lifestyle center offers free cooking classes to the community where attendees can learn how to make wholesome foods that are good for the body, mind and soul. Some of these foods include wheat bread and several vegetarian meals. Many people are being introduced to the gospel through the health message. Amen! 










&#8220;Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God&#8221;  

1st Corinthians 10:31.










All of the workers at this lifestyle center have a united mission of helping the guests have a personal encounter with Jesus. In order to accomplish this, there is time to open the bible and reflect on the wondrous truths found therein. This lifestyle center encourages those who come to live a healthy life. As one recovers their health and improves their lifestyle, they will discover how God’s simple remedies can help anyone to live a full life, as He originally intended.
