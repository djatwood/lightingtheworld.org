*This is told in the perspective of Brother Allan, a worker for the Lord. *











&#8216;Brother Allan, please come back right away at our house! Stop selling soymilk first! We have 1 baby patient here who has difficulty in breathing!&#8217; 

As we were selling our vegetarian products and soymilk in one of the local towns, a fellow church member called me and asked for help. I knew I still had more homes to visit and sell my products to, but the Holy Spirit prompted me to go and check the tiny patient who had been suffering from breathing difficulties.

Upon arrival, I saw a very weak baby girl (1month old), gasping for breath. It was brought to my knowledge that her lungs were full of phlegm. To my surprise, the baby and her parents came from two huge hospitals that had no remedies to give to the child. The tiny baby could not drink her milk and I saw that she was below her underweight. I immediately prayed for divine wisdom, that God may use me to help this family. The Lord reminded me of a healing providence was used on our first-born child. I told the mother of the infant to get calamanci and garlic and place it in a half glass of water. Through the help of a medicine dropper, the mother gave her that medicine. At first, the mother was hesitant because of the facial expression of the baby. Just a few minutes after, she was able to breathe in normally without gasping for air and her appetite for milk returned! She had a good sleep that evening.  

2 months later, we spoke with the infant’s father, who was thankful for the remedy. He was very surprised of the simplicity of the cure! He spent more than a 1000USD in the hospital, but the condition of his baby hadn’t changed. He testified that the God we are serve is truly alive. Through this experience, he expressed that he would like to have bible studies. Praise God for proving to us that health evangelism work will be a mighty instrument to serve and help those who are suffering.
