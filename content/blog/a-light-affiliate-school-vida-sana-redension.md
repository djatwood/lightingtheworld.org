Discover with us our LIGHT affiliate school &#8220;Vida Sana Redénsión&#8221; in Colombia:





Vida Sana Redension is a medical missionary training center in Fusagasuga, Colombia. The ministry also includes a lifestyle center, restaurant, bakery, and primary school. In addition, the ministry offers a restoration program for people suffering from addictions.

The medical missionary training center attracts families and young people alike. Part of the training involves developing skills to help the students be self-supporting, as well as classes to prepare them to use their abilities and talents to serve God. Whether conducting health demonstrations for the community, producing tasty baked goods, or helping in the vegetarian restaurant and lifestyle center, the medical missionary students are able to practice what they are learning on site.

Various challenges have helped the team enlarge its vision as the ministry continues to develop a better grasp of God’s plans for its impact in the community. Through faith and perseverance, the team has grown, grateful for God’s blessings and His divine direction. The ministry asks for your prayers and support as it seeks to advance God’s work in South America.
