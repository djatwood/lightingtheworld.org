We thank the Lord for continuing to answer our prayers, so far we have 8 students who will be coming to 6 month training.  Four of them confirmed that they will be paying while others are still raising funds.

We had weekend medical missionary training on from 18th &#8211; 20th March in East of Johannesburg , we had 60 people who came and 24 for cooking classed on Sunday, it was such a great experience for many of them. They indicated that it was for the first time hearing about the medical missionary work.

My wife is spending a one week in Cape town conducting cooking school with George, they are having graduation together with some students who attended the one month training in January 2011. Three of the student will be in six month training.

I remained here in Free State as I was preparing for the evangelistic campaign that I will be running in 03rd  to 23rd April 2011.

Since I started with Bible work, I am meeting different groups during the week.  On Sabbath we meet with about 15 to 20 people&#8230; Seven of them indicated they want to be baptized this past sabbath we went to Bethlehem Church about 45 minute drive away. (The) mother who gave her house to be used  for meetings gave a testimony how health programs and expos have changed her life, she is the one who persuaded that we start evangelistic campaign, she asked us to use her tent for the meetings.  Every day she goes out house-to-house inviting people for our meetings. The people at the Church in Bethlehem are amazed by what the Lord is doing and have promised to assist us when the meetings are about to start.  Indeed health message is pioneering the work and we thank the Lord  for prayers offered from the LIGHT prayer network.  We are requesting for more prayers as the Lord is leading His work.
