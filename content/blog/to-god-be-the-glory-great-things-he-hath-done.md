It is hard to believe that we have been in Curacao for one full month. What a month it has been. Dr. Panneflek, who is the health and Temperance leader informed me that we would have at least 12-20 persons.To our surprise, on the first day of class we had 80 persons registered. As the first week of class progressed more people wanted to join the class but we had to have a cut off point when the number reached 95.

Although our classes were schedule for the evening, we were kept busy visiting family members, or friends of the students or church members who were requesting our advice or help. We also visited the three SDA schools on the Island and spoke to the students about the 8 laws of health.  

We visited one woman who suffers with back pain and was not getting much relief from the pain medication she was taking. She also suffers from high blood pressure. We did a general revulsive treatment for her. Her blood pressure was 145/89 initially, but after the treatment it went down to 90/62. Her sister and brother were present. They all were surprised at the results from so simple a treatment. We also visited an individual with Elephantitis and made some lifestyle recommendations for her.  

Each Sabbath we were asked to preach at a different church to share the health message. Curacao have 32 churches.  We visited a total 14 churches for the month. Many of the members who did not get a chance to attend the classes are asking for another school in Curacao.  

Nathalie Isenia, who works for Hoyer radio station and a Television station, attended our classes and was impressed with the information she received. She asked us to  please come to the radio station and share some of the information on Cancer, Heart Disease, Diabetes and the 8 laws of health with the people of Curacao. We did 3-one hour sessions and taped an extra session to be aired in the coming week. One session was a call in session where we answered question from the public. The response from the people was over whelming.  

Ethel Pieters, an employee from our SDA Delta radio station also invited us to speak about the 8 natural health laws.

Ingrid Kirindingo, a nurse trained as a medical missionary at Wildwood, was also instrumental in bringing LIGHT to Curacao. She lives in West Palm Beach, Florida with her husband who is a doctor. We appreciate her presence here with us and all the help she gave, including being our designated driver to and from classes. Seven members of her family attended the course. One of them came from Holland just to attend the classes.

Pastor Shurman Kook, the president of the Curacao Conference attended the first day of classes, and was the guest speaker for the graduation of the students. We were thankful for his presence in our midst.

Our Health Expo was a success. Within the first hour after opening the doors, we had one hundred persons We had a total of 250 persons visiting our different stations. The students were excited to share what they had learned for the past month. Many of them have expressed an interest in taking the 6-month school. I will follow up in the coming months.  

Our accommodation In Curacao was a blessing. A home away from home. God provided a lovely home for us with all the amendments we needed to be comfortable and for the cooking classes. Mrs. Lydia Lubliek, an 88 year old woman, who uses her home as a guest house, is a warm and friendly person who enjoys talking and sharing stories of her past with us. She is very alert with a quick mind, and still drives herself around town. Her grandfather was trained under Kelloggs in 1898.  

Her helper Mavlyn was a blessing to us in many ways and assisted with the prepping for cooking schools and housekeeping.  

Margarita, a newly graduated student from the Dominican Republic (Shanielle) was eager to share her knowledge with the Hydro demonstrations.  

After breakfast we went walking collecting different herbs native to Curacao and enjoyed the colorful houses in the neighborhood.

I am grateful for the team working so well together. Blessings, Blessings.  

To all the people who worked behind the scenes, this program would not have been a success without you. Many thanks.  

To Sister Panneflek and Joy, thanks for the part you both played in translating and filling in wherever help was needed. Many thanks and blessings.  

The class of Curacao. We will miss you greatly, and pray that God will inspire you to use the knowledge to make lifestyle changes not only for this earth, but for eternity.

God Bless.

Cynthia Bonas, Regional Director for Caribbean LIGHT schools.
