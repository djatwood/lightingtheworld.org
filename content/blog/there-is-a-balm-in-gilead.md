We praise our good God who hath bestowed upon His remnant church the Ministry of Health Evangelism. Through this, Madam Irene Curfs, one of our teachers and I (George Agungu) a Student at LIGHT-Kenya, came in contact with Damaris Atieno, during our class afternoon community outreach program.

Damaris is a grandmother in her late 80s, who has her share of afflictions.  She is deserted by both friends and relatives, leaving her with no one to take care of her.  She lives in utter poverty.  Her neighbors steal crops from her small farm, and she receives repeated threats of witchcraft from her own family.  Her health is failing her as she suffers from a serious goiter, as well as some other diseases.   All this has made Damaris suffer mentally, physically, socially and spiritually. Before we met her, she had no church family or relationship with her Creator.

I (George), remember Damaris narrating to me how she had been sent away from the hospital because she had too much diseases to be attended to. She showed me two big polythene bags full of drugs and used plastics bags (used in packaging drugs).  None of this helped. Damaris was in so much pain from the goiter to the point that her throat would be coarse on the inside and she would experience much pain when coughing.  She also complained about abdominal pains together with stomach ulcers, backaches, hip pain. Damaris suffers from open wounds all over her toes and one big wound on her left leg with much discomfort at both soles.   










&#8220;For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in.&#8221;  

Matthew 25:35.










This grandma had no story to tell of God’s love towards her.  Only complaints and lamentations came out of her.   She had stopped attending her former Catholic church as it was too far to walk there.  She joined the local P.E.F.A (Pentecostal Evangelical Federation of Africa) who had initially visited her but even there she has stopped attending due to her pain, loneliness, discouragement, and frustrations.

However, glory to God, there is a Balm in Gilead. Our Father is also our Heavenly Physician.  Since we began visiting, we would pray with her, apply simple remedies, and feed her healthy foods. We would also encourage her from the Word of God, and help her accomplish some simple duties around her house. These simple tasks put a smile on Damaris’ face.  One day, she told us, “You people are good… your kindness has touched me”  

It’s amazing how fast the wounds have been healing and drying. The goiter is reducing and she no longer complains of the throat aches and coughs &#8211; though still a little bit of pain with the intestines. We can trust more, as we look at her past situation, that God is doing more exceeding abundantly than we can ask or think. Praise God!










&#8220;Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us.&#8221;  

Ephesians 3:20.










The conversations have been changing from lamentations to praises. Glory to God! She’s even been giving gifts of vegetables and beans to us. 

We believe Damaris will soon be whole, praising God and witnessing to her neighbors and relatives about God’s hand in her life.  

Please pray for the LIGHT-KENYA school that they may be blessed by God to continue teaching others how to touch the community through Health Evangelism.
