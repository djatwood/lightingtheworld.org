*This is told in the perspective of Shanniel Fisher, LIGHT’s Inter-America Divisional Director.










In December of 2018, Liz Hall from Wildwood gave me the number for Ms. Louise Thompson in St. Maarten. This was regarding a 1-month LIGHT school in her country. After contacting Ms. Thompson, we decided that June would be the best month for the school. We had several meetings as we planned for the school. Some of the challenges we faced were financial, due to the hurricane they suffered in 2017. We also did not have enough students registered by the deadline. Despite these challenges, God overruled and eventually 171 students registered for the LIGHT one-month school.

On June 1, 2019 the North Caribbean Conference President, Pastor Desmond James, officiated the opening ceremony along with Pastor Cuvalay, the coordinator for the SDA churches in St. Maarten.

151 students successfully completed the program, including a 95 year old woman, two medical doctors, 1 pastor, several elders and 10 non-adventist individuals.  

Due to the large group and time constraints, we were only able to allow 10 students to give their testimony, 3 of which were non-SDA. Their testimonies were very encouraging and uplifting. We went on 3 different radio stations to promote the Health Expo and to share the 8 laws of health with the audience.

The elementary SDA school invited us to speak with the students about health on 2 occasions. We also taught them scripture songs which they enjoyed immensely along with their teachers.  

Our team consisted of Shanniel Fisher (LIGHT’s Inter-America divisional director), Cynthia Bonas (LIGHT’s Carribbean school director), Teresa Thornhill and Alma Diaz-Stewart.

We culminated our one-month program with a health expo! Over two hundred individuals visited the various booths. We also had the mobile clinic on the premises conducting testing for AIDS. It was a great success! The students were delighted and enthusiastic to share the knowledge which they obtained during the past four weeks.  

One of the students attending the course learned about the benefits of charcoal. She shared this information with her colleague, who has been suffering for a long time. During the past year, this gentleman has endured many sleepless nights, with consistent visits to the emergency room. It has become a routine for him to suffer from high fevers, nausea and vomiting daily. The student bought some charcoal and gave it to her colleague. Directions were given on how to prepare the slurry water. After consuming the first drink, her colleague vomited in copious amounts. The dosage was given again and he vomited a moderate amount. A third dose was given. This time, he did not vomit! That night, for the first time in one year, he was able to sleep through the night in peace. His appetite has improved and his overall health is getting better daily. He is due for a visit to the doctor on Monday to have some blood work done. He is anxious to see what the results show.

God is doing amazing things in this area of the world, and we know He will continue to do even greater things in these last days of earth’s history.

Praise God from whom all blessings flow!
