*This is told in the perspective of Amanda Mendieta, the director of the LIGHT affiliate school in  Peru Projects (which is located in Pucallpa, Peru).











Jesus visited me in the jungle  

I am Victoria and I am serving as a missionary in a community inside the Peruvian jungle, &#8220;Juancito.&#8221; I was sent to this place after having finished my preparation in the Missions School of Peru Projects. One fine day, approximately 2 months after reaching to my missionary field, I felt the great need to have the Holy Spirit in my life in order to fulfill the mission of evangelizing. So, I made the decision to fast for 3 days. On the third day of fasting, I woke up like at 1 in the morning and I was sleepless. I had a very strong need to feel sure that God was with me and that He had not abandoned me. I felt that I had no more strength to continue. I got up and suddenly I heard Diana, my friend and missionary partner begin to sing “Today is the day of your salvation,” while she was totally asleep. Then, the thought came to my mind that this was the day for me –the day of my salvation. So, I got down on my knees and started to beg God to pour out His Holy Spirit in my life. While I was talking with Him, I could clearly hear Him ask me: “Where are you Victoria?” Then, I answered, “I am here, Lord. Behind the little school. In the wooden house.” Then, I saw that Jesus walked and looked for the little house, behind the school, and came to the door. I said, &#8220;Lord, I am here I am, inside. When He came inside, He stopped and started to look and see how we had arranged our house. He looked in the table drawers and He looked at the work that we had done to teach the children of the community. I said, “Lord, I am here in my room.” He entered in and His gaze settled on my friend for a long time. I said: “Lord, she is Dianita.”

I told her that she was going through difficulties and I asked Him to help her. Then, I told Him, “I am here, Lord.” He came and sat on my bed and then I said: “Lord, let my head rest on your knees.” He did. We began a long conversation and I saw that my whole life was opening up, like a book. After that long conversation, I could then experience a deep peace, the assurance of His forgiveness, the assurance that He was with me, and that He would never, ever leave me alone. I could clearly see that it was Jesus Himself, who had come to comfort me and give me strength to finish His work. This encounter marked my life a lot. Every time I bring it to my memory, it encourages me to continue looking with hope, to be assured that in this life and in my missionary service, I am not alone. It is Jesus Himself Who goes with me and every time that I talk to people and I visit families, I can talk to them with the assurance that I speak to them about a God who is very real.
