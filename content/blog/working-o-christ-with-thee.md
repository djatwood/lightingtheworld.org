*This story is told by Joseph, a LIGHT worker in Africa











Greetings, everyone! I write this correspondence with great joy to give an update of God&#8217;s work in Zimbabwe. We appreciate your support through your prayers and donations. 

There have been many wonderful things that have taken place in 2018 so far. The Mutare Nature’s Wat Health Trust has been supplying services to the community with treatment rooms in Mutare and a sanitarium in Nyanga. 2 houses are being rented out with fertile land. The garden has enough produce to cater for the staff and patient’s nutritional and medicinal needs. Assorted vegetables and herbs are being grown. The team has started processing dried herbs as well.

To date, Charles Hleza reports they have successfully ministered to 18 patients that have different diseases. They have also conducted an organic gardening workshop to 10 students, a midwifery workshop to 20 participants, and they have just finished a “true education” seminar on April 22.

As part of their community outreach, a Sabbath School branch has been established at the sanitarium.

This year’s goals include:  

 1. Increasing Organic Market Capacity  

2. Lifestyle Education for Non-Sick Community  

3. Health Expos  

4. Website

In Mhondoro, our special focus is on food security. We are now harvesting rice with winter crops in the ground.  

We thank God for the establishment of yet another center in Gweru at Pangolin Hive Lodge, which is dedicated to health evangelism training.  

We are waiting for reports from the team there and at Tetbury at the time of this writing.  

Pray for us as we gather sources and resources
