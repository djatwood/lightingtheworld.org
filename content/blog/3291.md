Leon Curfs, our East Africa regional director praises the Lord for the following:

For having finished our first semester, of four months, with 8 students at our own mission school on our own land. (which is a blessing having taught all over Kenya since 2008)

We were able to purchase one more bull totalling our bulls to five allowing us to plow with four bulls and have one bull rest.

We also were able to purchase a drip irrigation system covering 150 square meters as a trial system which we wish to expand to 3000 square meters.

For the opening through the health message to present in Sunday Churches.

And, for two workers that will arrive in January for a three month stay.

What a blessing!!!
