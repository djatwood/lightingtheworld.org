One day I went to visit my village last year for voting.  Many people had seen many changes in me.  My friends were married and living very rough lives of drinking, partying, gambling and card playing, etc. My sister told me one day that people were talking about me and really liked my habits and have seen a real change in my lifestyle. One neighbor came to me and said, &#8220;Please, take my son and make him like you.&#8221; I explained indirectly how the change takes place. So, I told her that I am willing to take him if he wants to go. Then, I explained everything to her son, Gavin. His brother had raised him since he was young, because his father had died of Tuberculosis and his mother had remarried.  His brother had tried his best to keep him from getting into bad habits. When Gavin got ready to go, he said he was going to study and his brother sent him off with his blessings.










&#8220;For the mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed; but my kindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall the covenant of my peace be removed, saith the Lord that hath mercy on thee.&#8221;  

Isaiah 54:10.










            When I took him to Nepal, Gavin went to the mountain.  Another young man, Kyle, from a Christian school also joined him.  The two young men became friends.  Kyle had accepted Jesus several years before.  He had received much persecution from his villagers and family. They beat and kicked him and even forced him to eat cow dung. They behaved very badly towards him.  They even burned his Bible. Although in the face of death, he would not leave Jesus.  Later, others had encouraged him to take training.  He was busy teaching, but when he heard of the opportunity to come to Nepal for training, he left his teaching and came.  Unfortunately, we were not able to start classes for them right away, as planned. However, God had another school for them. Ramon and I taught them guitar and Gavin really showed interest in it.  Gavin came from a Hindu family and knew nothing about God.  I taught him how to open and read the Bible. He took much interest in what was taught from the Bible and kept good notes.

      Kyle realized whatever he did, Gavin would also do.  So, he felt a big responsibility to be a good witness to him.  They both diligently helped around anywhere they could.  Through their time in the mountain they became diligent, hard-working, humble men.  They both come from the plains.  It is a whole different life to live in the mountains and to walk on the steep slopes.  They gradually learned how to live in the mountains.  They also helped in the broom grass field. It was hard to work with the knife-like leaves of the broom grass and the stinging nettle and the steeps but slowly they caught on. One day Kyle had a jungle knife in one hand and a water bottle in the other. He stepped on some dry, slippery grass and the next moment he was plummeting down the mountain. The bottle went one way and the knife the other and he did a full flip on his way down. Mercifully there were no boulders in this area and he crashed some 12 feet or so below.  He was quite shaken, but there were no injuries.  After taking some rest and much needed massages for a couple of days, he was up and working again.  It was a real testimony to him and Gavin how God is alive and hears their prayers.

           Because of Kyle and Gavin&#8217;s faithfulness and perseverance, I pressed forward to begin the Bible Seminary on January 31.  When we moved to India, we had only one week to get everything ready.  We had only empty rooms and our personal bags when we came but they pitched in and helped us get everything ready.  They helped us from dawn to dusk and we were able to begin just on time.  They are doing well, studying hard and making much progress.  Kyle has a great desire to work for God and has already been encouraging his roommates in the way of the Lord.  Pray that these young men may be fit vessels for the Lord to use in a mighty way.
