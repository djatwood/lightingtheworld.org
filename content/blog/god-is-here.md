As a 28 year old teacher at an Adventist dormitory school in Norway, it seemed that I lacked nothing. To my suprise, life took an unexpected turn. I was an Adventist, and had tried to live according to my faith as best as I could. However, through a series of events that involved my loved ones getting hurt, I was deeply convicted that I needed to learn how to take care of others. God is love, so I know that I needed to learn from Him.

I had visited the Matteson Mission School several times, and even taught a class or two. I knew that it was a place where you had to work closely with others in various activities. Strengths and weaknesses are made known to yourself and to those around you. I asked God to teach me how to care for people around me. I did my best to apply this beautiful principle to every teacher and student.

The time I spent in Matteson was imperative for my spiritual development. Month after month, God brought me into challenging situations. My much younger, and even more choleric, outreach partner helped me to understand how others would sometimes feel around me. I started to realize that “my way” was not always the best way. My prayers to God were focused on Him giving me a changed and renewed heart. For me, these “trials and obstacles” became “the Lord’s chosen methods of discipline and His appointed conditions of success” (Ministry of Healing p.417). 

Step by step, I started to realize that I was growing. All praise and glory belongs to our loving, tender, caring and merciful Father in heaven. I praise God for the opportunity to study at Matteson. I have also been blessed with the opportunity to work here, longer term. God used the Matteson Mission School to help me grow and develop into the person He has created me to be. May the Lord be praised!
