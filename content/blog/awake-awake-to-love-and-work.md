*This experience is told through the perspective of Shanniel Fisher, the Inter-America Divisional Director.











This Country has been a dormant field over the years and we have not been able to do much training in this area. Upon visiting church leaders in one of the conferences there last year, the administers shared that it’s very difficult to carry out health programs because of fanatical groups that has given a rather bad impression of the message of health.

The President of this particular conference asked me to pray with him for several months as he seeks to meet with all his pastors with the plan of having a training with them first, then with church members at a later date. There was much resistance at first, as the pastors didn’t see the need for such training especially because of the history of fanatical teachings in that area. Finally, they all agreed to give it a try. After a 40-hour training with the pastors away from their fields, we gathered together at a health retreat center. Our team was called for a meeting with their conference president. They all concluded that “this training has been the best thing that has ever happened in their lives, ministry and families!”

They therefore on the spot, requested another training specifically for elders, health directors of all the churches and health professionals. This training will be done in November of this year. Thank God for the miracles in Nicaragua!
