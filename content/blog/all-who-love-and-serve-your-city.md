*This is told in the perspective of a LIGHT worker in India. Names will not be disclosed for safety reasons.









During the month of February, meetings were held pertaining to Health Evangelism in India. Due to the tense political situation in this area, the original place where the training was going to be held ended up being changed. Interestingly enough, the students who were being trained at this location also hold the position of pastoral leadership! 

The day finally came for the pastors to go door-to-door in a small community. This area had a known disdain for Christianity. Nonetheless, the pastors went by faith to be a light in a world of darkness. God worked miraculously in keeping everyone safe, despite the prejudice that the pastors faced.

Hundreds of doors were visited in a short timeframe. The pastors spent their day doing health surveys in this community. When the group finished their assignments, several stories of God’s power were shared, to encourage others that the Lord is in control. One pastor shared of how a child was unconscious on the street that he was working on. The mother of the child was crying and hurried to the pastors and asked them to pray for her son. As one pastor prayed, the other pastor used a natural remedy on the young boy. Miraculously, the child became conscious again. Afterwards, the pastors invited the mother to come to church with them, thus creating an opening wedge for that mother and son to come to Jesus! What a blessing that turned out to be!

Another story was shared about how two pastors knocked on a door of a house that was surrounded by statues and idols! The pastors were skeptical if they would have any success with reaching the people residing in this household. Upon knocking, the pastors began talking and sharing their personal testimonies with the people. Soon enough, neighbors began overhearing the testimonies and became curious about what was going on. Thus, creating yet another opportunity for the love of Jesus  to reach those who may have never heard of Him. To God be the glory, for He is worthy to be praised!
