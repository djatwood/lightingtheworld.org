From the British Virgin Island Tortola










Tortola is one of the smaller Islands of the West Indies. In the summer of 2019 we were very excited when we received a call at our LIGHT office with the request for Health Evangelism Training! In November 2019 we conducted our very first full Month training in the Island. Over 80 church members and members of the community came together for this certification course. 

Beverly, a relatively new member of the Seventh-Day Adventist church, was one of the students that attended the course. Prior to her conversion, she was a member of the Baptist church for several years. She started taking bible studies and eventually became an Adventist sometime later. Later she got married and also became a teacher of the SDA Academy with over 300 students. Beverly was invited to attend our LIGHT training by one of her colleagues, but it seemed impossible to her to attend; Nevertheless she decided just to stop by the second night with no intention of attending the following session. She was willing to pay for the single night visit, but the course coordinator told her it wasn’t necessary and therefore she left. Surprisingly the next night Beverly was there again and for the entire Month she was present. She couldn’t resist the important information that were shared on health and wellbeing.

Although she was a Baptist before she became an Adventist, she knew of the principles and standard of the SDA Church. But upon her baptism, she discovered that it wasn’t what she was expecting, therefore it became very discouraging for her throughout the past few years. Now, at the end of the training she shared how elated she was and exclaimed “this is exactly what I needed”. She decided to use the LIGHT Manual as a resource tool with her students at the academy and for her family. It didn’t stop there, she requested that all those that were in attendance of the training to go to the academy that she teaches and have an Health Expo for the Students. In January they had the health expo as was requested with a mini cooking school. The students were very excited with the delicious samples that they received at the nutrition booth. Just a week ago another expo was done, but this time it was for the Parents Teacher Association (PTA). In the end it was an amazing turn out with the highlight being the cooking classes, with a special focus on how to make attractive and delicious meals for their children. Parents and Teachers were especially so happy and excited to try out the new dishes at home. 

Now there are several calls throughout the Island for health expos and seminars. Let’s continue to pray for Beverly and the little Island of Tortola as they use simple but powerful health evangelism methods to reach their community.
