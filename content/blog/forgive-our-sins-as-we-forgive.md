Adam is a small, handicapped young man.  Born without hands, he had been able to do what he wanted most of his life.  Throughout his schooling, they just passed him from one grade to another even if he didn&#8217;t pass.  He was always the life of the party, dancing and singing until late at night. Card playing and gambling became a way of life. He didn&#8217;t drink, but he was addicted to Gurkha, a fast-food that had betel nut and tobacco in it. His sister became a Christian and later married a student from here. She taught him many things. He wasn&#8217;t interested, but with daily worship he slowly accepted the Lord and was baptized. But he still had not overcome his bad habits and the pull of the party life was strong.  Any time there was a puja or wedding he was sure to be there with his friends most of the night. His brother-in-law took him to his place for some time, but when he returned to his home he was back in the bad habits. He loves to sing and preach and share with others about God but he could not overcome these bad habits.  His sister really wanted to take the Women&#8217;s Ministries course with us but with a child she has not been able. 










&#8220;I have said these things to you, that in me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation. But take heart; I have overcome the world.&#8221;  

John 16:33.










So, she sent Manjeet here.  He was accustomed to roaming freely and to buckle down and study was hard.  One day he had to go home for some business and at that time there was a wedding near his home.  When they offered him meat he didn&#8217;t accept it. He also shared what meat does to the body.  His relatives were surprised at his change. Then in the other room many young people were dancing.  He watched for some time.  He was struggling what he should do.  Just then, his friends caught him and put him in their midst. With the loud music, he was soon moving with them.  That night when he went home, he felt very guilty. We had not taught anything about this subject yet, but the Holy Spirit was convicting him he had done wrong. He came back and confessed his wrongdoings.

That same week another relative was getting married.  He wanted to go so much (his home is only a few hours from here)! I told him he needed to choose to study or just enjoy life and roam around.  I went to town and he decided he was going home.  However, the teachers and his sister counseled him and didn&#8217;t give him traveling money.  So, he didn&#8217;t go.  On Friday evening, before Sabbath, he came and asked forgiveness.  I had seen a real change in his studying habits during the week and it made my heart rejoice.  God is working with these rough specimens.  Pray for them as they seek to be overcomers and prepare to go to heaven.
