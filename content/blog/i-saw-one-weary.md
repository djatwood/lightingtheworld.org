*This is told in the perspective of a LIGHT worker in South America.









Here is a story from one of our team leaders: “When we began our training, many of the people seemed to be very hesitant and the atmosphere seemed almost cold among the participants.  We went home that night and began to pray. Over the next few days, things begin to change, and people became more receptive and excited about what they were learning.

 Finally, about 10 days after beginning the program, as we were doing a training on how to do Health Expos, it made my heart so joyful to see the eyes of the participant&#8217;s sparkle, and express enthusiastically, ‘This is just what we need for our community! We will go out and seek to bless our community through what we are learning! Thank you so much for coming to share with us!’ Praise God for the opportunity to be able to prepare missionaries to serve unitedly with their church leaders in their own communities and churches.” Amen!
