This story is told in the perspective a missionary named Amanda, who is affiliated with Peru Projects.










With classes commencing in 2018, we had 17 young people leave everything they knew, to travel through perilous jungles, where thousands of people are waiting for a missionary to accompany them and teach them of God&#8217;s love.

Before entering, the team of leaders of Peru Projects together with the group of young people, united as a single missionary family to celebrate the first Induction service of 2018 for the new missionaries who answered God’s call to serve.

The purpose of the course has been to strengthen individuals to live a life of service to the Lord. From very early on, young people begin the day seeking their communion with God, doing physical exercises, worship services and prayer for the anointing of the Holy Spirit.

We thank God, to see in each one of these young people, the firm purpose of serving Him wherever He sends them. Whether they are traveling by plane or by boat, they are all very motivated and willing to depart to their missionary fields.

Eight of the eleven zones of the district near Peru Projects will have the permanent presence of a couple of volunteer missionaries. This will encourage and strengthen the faith of our brothers and sisters to spread the faith of Jesus Christ in areas where souls are hungry for the truth. We pray that the Holy Spirit will continue to work through the Ministry of Peru Projects, and that more missionaries can be brought to the field to fully evangelized. I long for the day when we will shall see Jesus Christ coming soon for the second time!
