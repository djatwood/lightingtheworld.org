My name is Barbara Katherinne, I&#8217;m 25 years old and was born in Belo Horizonte. I have been a strict vegetarian for almost a year. Although I do not agree with the cruelty exercised by the meat industry there were other reasons that led me to a change in lifestyle. I went from being a former cheese addict to a strict vegetarian.

For most of my childhood I faced respiratory problems. I was hospitalized several times with strong attacks of asthma and my parents suffered quite a bit while I was in the hospital. After many treatments the crises disappeared during my adolescence. But I could never have pets, curtains, carpets &#8230; Also, I had to take some precautions so that the crises would not come back. But in college my problems started again.

I left home to study journalism in São Paulo and this time my food practically became lacto-ovo vegetarian. This was the diet adopted at the institution where I lived and studied. Although I ate meat from time to time, the biggest problem was the secret love I had for cheese. I would even consume large amounts during meals. When I returned to Belo Horizonte I was overweight, depressed and sick. My asthma attacks returned with full force and I didn&#8217;t have a will to do anything.

After trying everything to lose weight without results, I heard about a lifestyle center that was about to open in Serra do Cipó and was interested. Lifestyle Center Serra do Cipó is a space that offers complete detoxification programs. The place is amazing and next to a beautiful circuit of waterfalls.

The time spent there was instrumental in the process of changing my lifestyle. I turned strict vegetarian and I did not feel the need to eat cheese. I considered it impossible! There had vegan cooking classes, hydrotherapy, massages among many other treatments. I learned that in addition to being careful about what I eat, it is also important to be aware of other &#8220;natural remedies&#8221; that influence my health, such as physical activity, sunlight and proper rest.

The results were immediate and visible on my skin, mood, behavior and disposition. Soon asthma ceased to bother me and I could return to physical activities without relying on inhalers. Weight loss was another bonus amongst the many benefits gained. There were five kilos during the program and seven more afterward, completing 12 total kilos eliminated in two months.

So my tip for anyone, for a healthier diet, a better life, better emotional control and peaceful sleep is: [Lifestyle Center Serra do Cipo](http://lifestyleserradocipo.org/).
