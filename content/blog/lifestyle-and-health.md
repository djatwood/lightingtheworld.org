Sooner or later most of us end up realizing how much our lifestyle affects our health, but we don&#8217;t always want to make changes according to the knowledge that we have. Elizabeth was one of those cases. She would always turn a deaf ear to those that would try to help her understand the importance of having breakfast, eating fruits and vegetables, etc. But after a little while, she started to see and understand more clearly the effect these things can have on health.

One day, she learned that her neighbor was diagnosed with cancer. Having been given only three months to live, she decided to make some major changes in her diet. The changes in her diet spanned the difference between given 3 months of life to being declared cancer free! This same neighbor that made such an impression on her mind also helped her to get started in changing her eating habits when she felt the need to do so. One day her daughter dropped by with this neighbor, bringing the items necessary for her to start working on changing her diet. It was difficult for her, but with some help from her children she was able to start eating salad and fruit, as well as other natural and healthy foods. Although resistant at first, she did end up changing her eating habits after some encouragement from her family to improve her health, and was blessed and benefited from the change.
