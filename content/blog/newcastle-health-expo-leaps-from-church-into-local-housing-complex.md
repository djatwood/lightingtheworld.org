The practical culmination of the [health missionary training](http://nec.adventist.org.uk/news/nec/needy-newcastle-prepared-for-health-boost) conducted in the Newcastle Seventh-day Adventist church by representatives of LIGHT, Lay Institute for Global Health Training, was a health expo conducted in Cruddas Park flats, just across from the church, on Thursday, 20 August.

Although only recently recognized as &#8216;_our village_&#8216; this residential block has overshadowed the church for years. A previous pastor, Melvyn Ellis, developed links with a now closed community centre within the block. We decided it was time to rebuild the connections.

The expo itself was arranged by Rudo Sibanda, Newcastle church Community Services leader, in cooperation with Violeta Lernacinska, the Tenancy and Estates Officer from Your Homes Newcastle who operate the building.

Violeta expressed she loved &#8220;the work you are doing, the professionalism and the attire of the staff manning the booths.&#8221;  

The team, who had just completed their training at the health missionary school staffed all of the expo stations with some extra help from local church members. Each pair caring for the expo stations had been trained in their respective tasks and could give simple health talks about their role – which was to encourage people to take greater charge of their own health.

A highlight of the whole expo was the chair massage to relax tired and stressed muscles. The week&#8217;s training in church, accompanied to the sound of backs being caressed with gentle hand strokes to the rather more vigorous sounds of &#8216;cupping&#8217; and &#8216;chopping&#8217; led to a confidence which showed that one-time novices were now experts in their new tasks.  

Following the expo, local members on the health team now suggest that cooking schools with massage is,&#8217;the way forward&#8217; for Newcastle church. Health checks were not the only elements of the expo. Time was taken to seek to develop friendships with visitors. One estimate suggested that 40 people came over during the three-hour period.

Church elder, Victor Samwinga, came away from the event with these thoughts, &#8220;I came back tired, of course, but greatly blessed myself. I saw so much brokenness; I heard so much pain, anger, stress and loneliness! We as their neighbors can offer people genuine friendship, minister to their needs, gain their confidence and point them to the One who can satisfy their souls&#8217; greatest desires.&#8221;
