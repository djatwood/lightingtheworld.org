Reported by Alain Bautista, Director of LIGHT Southeast Asia










“A person who lives without the Holy Spirit is like a balloon without oxygen or a car without oil. A person without the Holy Spirit is useless.” – Pastor Ron Genebago, Youth Director, Southern Asia Pacific Division.

It was the busiest final week of training for Batch 22 before their commitment service. Everyone was trying to finish the necessary requirements before being deployed for their one-month medical evangelism. Some only had few hours of sleep due to cramming, but one thing is for sure: they learned to trust God more and ask Him into their lives, so they can be more useful in the service. One trainee expressed, “I don’t like to finish my requirements just for the sake of finishing them to get deployed. What’s the use of completing everything if I will not gain Jesus in my life? I want to finish everything while knowing and appreciating the character of God.”

Before the sun settled down, last February 14, every single one of the trainees finally completed their requirements, and they all had a wonderful time welcoming the Sabbath with worship, songs of praise and adoration.

On the day of the commitment, several LIGHT graduates came to join us for a very special Sabbath day. During the Sabbath School program, the trainees were asked to share experiences of their weekend deployment areas to inform the church members of the vastness of the work in store for them and to encourage people to follow their example. For divine hour, we heard a sermon that impacted not only the trainees but also the people who attended that day. As a conclusion, there was an appeal to recommit their lives to God’s service. The students then sang the song, “This Witness I Will Bear.”

The morning after the program, everyone got ready to be sent to their mission assignments. At seven o’clock, we gathered to pray for the baptism of the Holy Spirit on each trainee. We prayed that they would be filled with power from Above and be prepared to face the work God would give them.

Tears were shed as the trainees finally realized they would be separated for a little while before gathering together again for their graduation, yet it was wonderful to see more people being equipped to move forward in this movement Christ has started.

We solicit your prayers for our nine trainees and six volunteers who are now preparing to evangelize in their deployed areas. May the good LORD empower each of us for the sake of the Gospel. Maranatha!
