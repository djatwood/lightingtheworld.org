While holding recent harvest campaigns in the Caribbean, a woman, hearing that we were Christians, asked us to come visit her 81-year old father, Saul, explaining “he’s dying from cancer.  We are not Christians, but he had a brother who died cancer, and before his death, he learned about Jesus and was greatly comforted and died peacefully. I want my father to be able to die like his brother”. Visiting Saul, in his humble thatched roof home, we shared our faith in the matchless love of God to send Jesus to die for our sins. Afterwards, we sang a few songs, prayed, and invited him to the evening meeting, offering transportation.

Though weak from his terminal illness, Saul came every night. We cannot erase the joy we felt the night Saul came forward to turn his life over to Jesus and the joy he expressed as he came up out of the waters of baptism. 

Praise the Lord, Saul’s daughter is now daily reading the bible to her father and studying God’s Word with our Medical missionaries as she seeks the same joy and peace in her own life. Perhaps God is impressing someone reading this short blog to get involved in helping reach the people of the Caribbean. Is God speaking to you, just now, to finish the work? We would love to hear from you as we finalize the evangelism teams for 2017. Is there yet another who may not be able to physically go at this time, but who can help someone else wanting to go, or the need for additional medical missionary gospel workers, building projects or purchase of houses of worship for Saul and other new believers? Together, let’s think of the everlasting love that He has showered upon us and ask Him for a heart to do exactly what He is calling us to do. What a blessing to follow the Lord, to be in His will. Unto Him be the glory throughout the ages!










&#8220;And heal the sick that are therein, and say unto them, The kingdom of God is come nigh unto you&#8221;  

Luke 10:9.
