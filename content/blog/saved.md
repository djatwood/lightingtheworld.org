A man in his mid thirties opens his eyes. The sun streams through a window in the beautify furnished master bedroom. The birds outside mingle there sweet voices with that of his two small children laughing in the living room. The day has started perfectly. The man turns over to wake his wife to this beautiful morning, but that is when everything changes.  

She is not there! Franticly he jumps out of bed, racking his mind for where she might be.  

As he stumbles into the bathroom, there, on the sink, is a note:










“Dear John, I have left for good. Expect a letter of divorce in the mail soon. Take care of the kids. &#8211; Linda&#8221;










The words rip through his eyes with such force that the tears fall unchecked.  

No, No, No! His mind screamed. This can’t be real! But it was; all to real. He stepped out of the bedroom and gazed at his little ones, playing innocently on the braided rug. How will I tell them… What will I tell them? Oh it’s too much for me to bare!

A rapid nock sounded at the door, interrupting his desperate thoughts. Walking over to the door he peered through the peep-hole and caught the sight up two cleanly-dressed young people—students of Advent Herald Academy. Unbolting the door he wipes his eyes and pries the door open.

“What do you want?” he grunts.  

“Good morning sir” the young ladies smiles and hands the man a flyer, “We are student from a Christian Academy in Tennessee and are here to invite you to a concert by the Advent Herald Quartet, a gospel youth quartet.”  

“Is that right… He takes the flyer and looks it over.  

“Well, tell you what, I’ll have a think ‘bout this and just maybe I shows up.”

That evening, as the concert hall began to fill, a tiered looking figure walks through the door, a young girl holding onto one of his strong hands and a small boy walking behind him.  

The small fiery band except a program at the door and move into the hall to find a seat. as they step into he hall, two young people walk up and greet him, the same two that invited him to the concert. The welcome him and lead him to a good seat near the front.

As the concert begins and the first strains of What a Friend We Have in Jesus touch the broken man’s ears, his heart begins to soften and melt.  

The sweet peace that had began the day now settled down upon his soul and he leaned back in his seat and sighed a deep sigh.

This is the goal of Advent Herald Quartet. I has worked it’s purpose and by God’s grace, will continue to for many years to come.
