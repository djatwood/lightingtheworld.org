There is an old man who used to be a gardener. His name is Kidane. He has no relatives to take care of him. Two months ago, someone brought him to the hospital in terrible physical condition.

Somehow, with the overload of patients in the hospital, he was forgotten and barely cared for. He was sometimes given some food and pain-killers, but that was it. One day, as Maria was explaining to a nurse how she can help her mother, the nurse suddenly remembered Kidane and showed him to us. When we found him, he had four really big, deep wounds from lying in the hospital bed for such a long time.

Philipp: “When I first saw him, he was lying on the bed, under a blanket. When I took the blanket away, there was a terrible smell. He was lying in his own feces and was barely conscious; it seemed he was fading away. He couldn’t move his arms or legs; he couldn’t even eat on his own. The nurse and I took him out of bed and washed him.” 

Maria: “After getting him clean, we started to apply charcoal poultices to his wounds for a few days. Then we switched to cabbage and honey poultices. In the mean time, Sebastian gave him regular charcoal foot baths for his wounded feet. We put him to sit outside in the sun.” 

Now our daily work is to wash him, change his poultices and to move him in the bed so that his bed wounds don’t become worse.  

Kidane has already gotten so much stronger! Sometimes, when he’s not in a good mood, we even have to be careful, because he’s so strong. His wounds are also getting better and better every day. 

From the beginning we prayed with him and for him. Some people at the hospital have even helped by reading to him from the bible.  

We see a lot of suffering and death at the hospital. But we’ve been able to learn so much there. They let us help out a lot even though we are not highly educated in this field. Maria has been giving natural treatments and she’s been doing it really well. Sebastian has also been irreplaceable. We couldn’t do it without him. He’s been like a professional nurse’s assistant. We are very happy that we can work there. We’ve been able to do so much together.

But above all, we praise God. When we first started working here at the hospital, all three of us were asking ourselves whether we could ever be useful there. We wanted to run away, because we felt so useless. But God has really done miracles. He has made each of us useful and we are so thankful for that.
