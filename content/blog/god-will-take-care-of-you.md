 **Sarah’s* Story**: I am 40 years old and I had been suffering from excruciating stomach burns for 2 weeks. As I expressed my misery to my friends, I was told that a lady from LIGHT would be arriving at my village to show us natural remedies at our local church next Sabbath afternoon. I was ecstatic! A week passed, and it was finally the Sabbath. I met with her and described my discomfort in great detail. Immediately, she recommended a treatment: Charcoal water!She also suggested to soak some Aloe Vera overnight and eat it in the morning. So I decided to try her suggestions, and it worked! Now I am feeling much better than I ever have before. I praise the Lord for sending us a wonderful sister in Christ who is well versed in medical missionary work.

**Anne’s* Story**: I am truly blessed to be a LIGHT representative because I have had the chance to meet and treat many women and children. With each individual case, I have had the opportunity to learn more medical terminology that pertains to various natural remedies. My husband takes care of 3 churches. Before we came to this territory, two of the churches struggled due to division among members. However, by God’s grace, we started an outreach program in the community. We went door to door, checking for people’s blood pressures and pulses. We also educated the village about good health practices and how to use the simple, natural remedies God gave us.










&#8220;Heal me, O LORD, and I shall be healed; save me, and I shall be saved: for thou art my praise.&#8221;  

Jeremiah 17:4.










In this way, we have started to develop our churches which has decreased church division, and now everyone in the village is attending our church! I praise God for all He has done. Thank you for your encouragement and prayers.
