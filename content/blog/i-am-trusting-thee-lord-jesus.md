About 1.2 billion people around the world speak some form of Chinese, as their first language. A very small minority have embraced Christianity and the masses are living in deep spiritual darkness. Although this statement may seem bleak, we know that the Lord will make a way for light to come through. Philippians 4:13 says, “I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me“. We must trust in the promises of the Lord, that nothing is impossible through God. Amen!

Clinging to this promise, we have some exciting news to share! We have been working for several months to produce our LIGHT Essentials of Health Evangelism Course in Mandarin and are nearing completion. Many months of labor, study, recording and editing are slowly drawing to an end. We are prayerfully hoping to release this course very soon, God-willing.

Testimonies to the Church, Vol. 7, says, “We have come to a time when every member of the church should take hold of medical missionary work… Everywhere people are perishing for lack of a knowledge of the truths that have been committed to us. The members of the church are in need of an awakening, that they may realize their responsibility to impart these truths. Those who have been enlightened by the truth are to be light bearers to the world. To hide our light at this time is to make a terrible mistake. The message to God&#8217;s people today is: “Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee” (7T 62.1). Amen!

We believe that the Lord has richly blessed this project thus far. Our prayer is that this training will bring light to those who are seeking it. We know that God will work mightily through this course, and that those who complete it will be able to share their skills in their homes, churches and local communities.

Please continue to pray that we can finish the final translations and recordings for our LIGHT Essentials of Health Evangelism Course in Mandarin.
