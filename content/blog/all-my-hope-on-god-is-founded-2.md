*This is told in the perspective of Rodney Bowes, LIGHT’s North Asia Divisional Director.









God truly is guiding the work of health evangelism in China. As some of you may know, the religious situation is quite delicate in the world’s most populated country. During this past year, several restrictions have been implemented that make it more difficult for people to share their faith. The good news is that, following Christ’s method alone will bring success in reaching people in any area of the world. 

Let’s take a look at this quote from the Pen of Inspiration, “Christ’s method alone will give true success in reaching the people. The Savior mingled with people as one who desired their good. He showed sympathy for them, ministered to their needs, and won their confidence. Then He invited them, ‘Follow Me’&#8230;We should ever remember that the object of medical missionary work is to point sin-sick men and women to the Man of Calvary, who takes away the sin of the world.

By holding Him in view, they will be changed into His likeness. We are to encourage the sick and suffering to look to Jesus and live. Let the workers keep Christ, the Great Physician, constantly before those to whom disease of body and soul has brought discouragement. Point them to the One who can heal both physical and spiritual disease. Tell them of the One who is touched with the feeling of their infirmities. Encourage them to place themselves in the care of Him who gave His life to make it possible for them to have life eternal. Talk of His love. Tell of His power to save” (MHH page 73).

Please pray that we can finish editing the Essentials of Health Evangelism manual in Mandarin so that many people can be benefited by this precious material.  We have been working with a team that is conducting community health programs for children and adults. We are very encouraged by the results. We trust that God will provide.
