*This is written in the perspective of our South America Divisional Director, Linda Bentancurt.










God opened the doors to conduct a Council on Vegetarian Nutrition and Health Ventures in support of the Adventist Church with 90 eager participants.  In addition to Pablo and I, we were blessed by the presence of Dr. Winston Craig, PhD, MPH, RD and Frank Fournier from OCI.  It was a joy to see the eagerness of each participant to put into practice what they were learning, and to hear so many say that they went away with far more than they had expected when they signed up.

In addition to this, I wanted to share a testimony from a lady who participated in the LIGHT course in July. She served as part of the health club since then, and recently participated in the Vegetarian Nutrition Council and Health Ventures in support of the Adventist Church.

She said, “I am very thankful for all the training provided by the brothers and sisters of LIGHT since July of last year. As a result, we have been able to work with clear ideas with the help for the community. Since the training, we have been going to various churches and to our neighbors, to share what we have learned. Some of these things include hydrotherapy, charcoal and cooking classes. The Lord tells us to share His message through health reform also. We know that this is the right arm of the third Angel&#8217;s message, and most importantly having Jesus in our hearts. We are very thankful for all you have done for us and we hope you can continue to come to our area and help to train us. It has been very valuable to us”.
