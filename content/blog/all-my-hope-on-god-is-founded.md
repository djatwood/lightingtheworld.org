*This is told in the perspective of Joshua, a LIGHT worker in India.

The diet of Tibetan people consist of cheese, milk, butter, yak meat, flour, and very little seasonings. Due to the infiltration of the Chinese, the Chinese diet has been integrated into their lifestyle. An American woman who has now been residing in this location for several years, shared that a common health problem amongst the Tibetans is high blood pressure and heart disease. Tibet is a mountainous terrain and generally a cool climate. Yet, depending on which region you go, the level of climate can differ. 

On this trip, I remembered a comment made awhile back from a pastor’s wife. She had previously taken a mission trip to Tibet. She said she asked the Lord this question, “God, the people here are so beautiful. Why are there hardly any people here who know You?” In which she felt the Lord’s response, “Because no one has come here to spread the gospel and teach them the Good News.” I could see myself now in the same thought of amazement at the lack of knowledge of Jesus Christ, our Savior, here in this precious land. 

There is a wonderful opportunity here to serve these people’s needs with the help of health evangelism. We are called to teach and share the love and truth that can only be found in Jesus Christ. If you or someone you know is interested in praying on this matter to go forth into this land, please contact me at joshua@lightingtheworld.org
