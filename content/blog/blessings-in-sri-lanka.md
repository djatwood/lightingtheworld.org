Dear friends,

I hope the Lord is blessing you and taking care of every need of yours. We just returned from our mission trip in Sri Lanka.

From the beginning I tell you it was a blessed time and thank you for your prayers and support.

We have stayed two months and having two LIGHT trainings.

First month was a training for the pastors at the Sri Lankan Adventist Mission Office. The pastors learned how to do the practical medical missionary work in their country. Soon after graduation they have applied all of them in their churches and have seen the results. Most of them told us that this was like a second breath or a new start for their ministerial work. The training gave them many ideas how to reach Buddhist people as well as how to strengthen the church and motivate them for mission. Finally we had 12 graduates. Next year we are expected to come back and do one more training for their wives also.

On the second month we have been on the south of the country. This mission was supported by the Switzerland Seventh Day Adventist Conference and plus some other sponsors. Pr. Arnold Zwahlen was the organiser. There we had personal evangelism programs and Two health Expos. One for children and one for adults. On this Health Expos we had government leaders which never thought that the Sevenths Adventist church has such good programs. Even we had a chief Buddhist Monk which was fully supporting the things we have said and encouraged us to continue. So we are expected now to do this programs for the whole country and the reputation of the church is growing. For those of you who never been in the Buddhist country should now that in Sri Lanka our church is not officially recognised, they work under the name of the financial association. Even this Buddhist Monk we learned that he was persecuting our church and some others protestants churches in the past 3 years. But I hope with such an approach God will bring to a better condition.

Having personal visits to the people we realised that there are so many sick and in need of solutions which the doctors could not give them. This need brought us to an idea to have one more school for the team who was coming from Switzerland. So in the mornings we had classes and in the afternoon we were going to the people. Finally we got 12 more students. This month I personally have seen the application of the Matthew 4:23-25. The fame of our work went trough all the villages and the people were asking us to visit their sick relatives and give them a treatment others were coming to our place. Finally the need was so big that we didn’t have time to visit them all so we started to teach the family members the treatment to do and giving them written instruction with the solutions for their disease. So many people got treated in a very simple way and prayers. Even such problems like paralysed people after treatments having improvements in their health. At the end 12 people decided to come to the church and join us for the service. So for the Sabbath we had more guests then the church members.

Not having time to share with you all, how some icy hearts melted in front of Jesus love to them.

Please continue to pray for this country and for our church there. So the Lord will give to the pastors who remained there in Sri Lanka help and courage to continue in the way they started.

God bless you all,

Serghei, Anastasya and Tanya
