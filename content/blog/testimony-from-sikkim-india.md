As told by Samantha Subhash, LIGHT India










Last October, we had the privilege to lead the One Year in Mission students on a short mission trip to Sikkim, India. I have heard many times that the gospel work in the north is much less compared to that of the south of India. During this trip, I was truly able to experience that for myself.

In Sikkim, about 28% of the population is Buddhist. During our time there, we went to visit a famous temple at the top of a mountain hoping to conduct a health expo for the people who live in that community. Unbeknownst to us, we visited during the time of an annual grand festival where thousands of devout Buddhists and monks come to spend anywhere from a day to a whole week chanting prayers all day in the temple. Throughout the course of the day, they repeatedly chant the same mantra over each bead on their necklace: “All peace unto men, and no suffering on earth.”

As hundreds of people were walking by us toward the temple, there was one particular woman who we just decided to ask about who we could speak to for permission to do a health program for the people there. The woman said, “I am the committee chairperson here. You can have all the permission to do so!” There were so many people passing by, yet Divine Providence lead us to the exact woman we needed to meet!

Our team quickly set up our booths, and we began to conduct a health expo for the people. Immediately a large group started to gather. Later, when this executive woman was free from her duties, she decided to come by and join in as a participant getting her health check-up. As the program continued, we began to see that everyone had many of the same health problems due to similar lifestyles. Due to this fact and the increasing number of participants, we decided to do a general consultation for groups at a time. In our consultation room, the executive woman started to listen closely to what was being said, and she became very interested in what we were doing. She started talking with us and asking many questions. She even ended up staying throughout the day to assist us!

As the executive woman observed us and through conversation, began learning more about what we do, she began to confide in us. She began to open up about her burdens for her people and the suffering they go through because of their health problems. She then went on to ask us for a day we had available to go see a piece of vacant land she had. She had a dream to open up a health clinic on the land to especially aid people with kidney problems as it seemed to be a prevailing issue. Our conversation, however, did not end there. She asked us if we were Christian, and we said “yes.” The woman shared that she had exposure working with Christians in Nagaland where she was included in a prayer group. She was open and interested in Christianity, and what she said next, took a moment for it to fully sink in.

She invited us to come and work with her in helping set up and run a health clinic, and in return, she would provide housing for us free of charge! Praise God! God led us to a family with the resources and the heart to work with! To add to all the good news, we discovered that there is also a community of Tibetan refugees near the plot of land. Many Tibetans have never heard of let alone spoken the name, Jesus, before, yet they are kind and peaceful people. This will be a great opportunity to reach this large group of people who have never heard about the Love of Christ.

We praise God for this open door, and we are praying for workers who are willing to go and share the health message and the gospel to this place where there is a lot of work to be done to reach souls for the Kingdom of Heaven!
