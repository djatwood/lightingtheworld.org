On Wednesday afternoon, I was ready to teach the NEWSTART program to my class. To my disbelief, half of the students were missing! Instead of coming to class, that group had gone out on outreach that afternoon.

After a while, Doctor Steve came to ask me what would be the proper procedure for multiple bee stings. I told him that a charcoal bath would suffice. On the way back from their outreach, the students found an old lady in a nearby forest that had been attacked by bees! That was the reason they were absent from my class. John, the hydro room coordinator, was heading towards the hydro room when one seminary student came running to him, asking for an ice cube. John asked, “What&#8217;s wrong?” The seminary students said that an older lady was stung by bees all over her body! John took one cup of charcoal water and ice and headed straight towards the location of the woman.

When he reached the site, he saw 3-4 students who were carefully removing the bee stings. The lady drank the charcoal water and was given ice massages for some time. The elderly woman said she felt much pain. John sent for Dr. Steve for assistance. As soon as he reached, we decided to take her to the hydro room. Dr. Steve carried her all the way to our campus. We applied charcoal all over her face, hands and legs while we were preparing the charcoal tub bath. We gave her a neutral bath with charcoal for more than an hour. When we finished everything, we asked her how she was feeling. She said she had some pain on her right elbow as well as one of her fingers on her left hand. We applied poultices on the affected areas. Then, we prayed with her and dropped her home in our ambulance. 










&#8220;And he said unto her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace, and be whole of thy plague&#8221;  

Mark 5:34.










The next day, one of our outreach students came and told us that she had visited her. The elderly woman reported that she had no pain at all! We did not use any medicine, except natural remedies. God will always be our Great Physician.
