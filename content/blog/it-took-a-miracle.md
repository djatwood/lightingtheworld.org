This year has been particularly special for me. Not only because I am personally experiencing God on a deeper level, but also because I see it in the lives of my students and volunteers. This year, we have 4 special people who joined us on campus. 3 of them are siblings of our volunteers and the other one is the son of a student.

These 4 special individuals have different personalities that would surely test your faith. As I see their families trusting God, despite the work inside the campus and other responsibilities in the foundation, it gives me the inspiration to continue on this journey. They make us smile, laugh, and realize many things that remind us of God’s goodness in our lives. At first, I thought that they would be a burden in this institution. However, God is using them to extend the love of Jesus Christ to everyone they know. They have become part of our family at LIGHT. I want to personally thank each of these individuals. They give me hope that God is with all of us, every step of the way. My initial burden became a living and tangible blessing.

To conclude, let us take the time to read the following quote from the book, A Call To Stand Apart. It says, “With such an army of workers as our youth, rightly trained, might furnish, how soon the message of a crucified, risen, and soon-coming Saviour might be carried to the whole world! How soon might the end come—the end of suffering and sorrow and sin! How soon, in place of a possession here, with its blight of sin and pain, our children might receive their inheritance where “the righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein forever;” where “the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick,” and “the voice of weeping shall be no more heard” (CSA 66.6). Amen!
