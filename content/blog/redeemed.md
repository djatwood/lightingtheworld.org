*This is told in the perspective of Maria Louiza Jade, our medical missionary nurse who is assigned to one of the churches in Cavite.










During my regular visits around my community, I have spent time with several patients. One of my patients was seeking help in regard to her son, who was ill and needed treatment. I gave her a short lesson on how to do a charcoal poultice. I explained how God could miraculously work through these simple remedies to provide relief. Interestingly enough, that mother went and shared the information she had learned with her friends, family and neighbors.

Other people who were suffering from ailments came, and asked about natural remedies that they could use in their very own home. This has opened the door for biblical principles to be shared. This experience showed me how the simple mode of healing has a positive chain reaction in the lives of others. This very fact has helped people on the road to physical and spiritual recovery. The health message has truly been an entering wedge for the gospel to be preached in this region.
