Sam, a poor and devout Muslim man, felt impressed to come to a LIGHT affiliated school in India. Upon arriving at the school, the director of the institution spoke to Sam. One thing led to another, and the director ended up sharing the teachings of Jesus with him. After this divine appointment, Sam started attending church regularly and even started taking bible studies!  

Since then, Sam became a Christian. At first, he kept his conversion to himself. For he knew how his fellow villagers would react to his change of religion. It didn’t take long before the villagers realized that he was no longer a Muslim. They disowned him and began to threaten him in many ways. They refused to buy anything from him and his family. This made life very hard. Nevertheless, Sam refused to give up his new love for Jesus.  

One of Sam’s aunts passed away and left him a large piece of land. It was fertile, and good for farming. Unfortunately, Paul (his cousin) tried his best to steal the land away from him. Paul told him that he wanted to exchange Sam’s inherited property for a smaller property. Of course, Sam did not want to, but Paul had a lot of influence in the village, and at last, Sam decided he would give his cousin what he wanted, thinking that perhaps this was God’s will.

Sam had to be there to measure the land with Paul. They started this process on Thursday. Sam kindly reminded Paul that they must finish their measuring before Saturday, so that he could still go to church and keep the Sabbath. Although Sam worked very hard to get the work done, Paul worked very slow. Friday evening had come, and there was still much to be done.  

Sam told Paul once again that he could not work any longer because the Sabbath hours were approaching. Angrily, Paul threatened Sam, saying, “I will make sure you don’t get any land”. Sam was determined to not let anything get in the way of him keeping the Sabbath. Paul was livid and went to the village elders and told them to demand that Sam stay to work on the measurements during the Sabbath. Sam unwillingly but humbly obeyed and didn’t go to church just as the elders requested, but they still decided to take even more from him and give it to his cousin.  

Paul acquired a back hoe to clear off the land, and the clearing work began early on Saturday morning. Just after starting, Paul was hit in the head by the back hoe and severely injured. He was rushed to the hospital, and the bills from the doctor were costly. All of the elders and villagers thought about how they had treated Sam and felt guilty for their actions. They saw the accident as a punishment for their wrong doings, and many came to Sam with their sincerest apologies. They believed Sam chose the right path because he stood up for what he believed in.  

Since this event took place, no one gives Sam a hard time for being a Christian. The villagers are talking to him again, and have welcomed him into their homes for fellowship. People are asking him questions about Jesus and His great love. Pray that God will use Sam in a mighty way to win souls for the Kingdom.
