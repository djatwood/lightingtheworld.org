&#8220;Call upon Me in the day of trouble; I will deliver you, and you shall glorify Me.&#8221;  

Psalms 50:15.










My family and I were not attending any church. Various circumstances forced me to grow up without my father. When I was ten years old, my mother got very sick. At that time, two Adventist women visited our home. They prayed for my mom and invited the whole church to pray for her health. Soon after, by God’s grace, she was fully healed. As a teenager, I lost my interest for religion. However, during my time in the military, I remembered God during my hardship. There were instances in which my life was in danger… I called upon the Lord and He heard me. After coming back home, I start visiting the church. In one year, I was already baptized and actively involved in the church service. Time was passing and I felt a need for something more. I was inspired by listening to many mission experiences from Africa. I started looking for the opportunity to be fully involved in the mission field like the ones described. When my pastor saw my sincere desire for mission, he suggested a local training center.

I gladly accepted the call.Before arriving at the center, I thought I knew my Bible pretty well. During my research, I realized that there was still much to discover! I really enjoyed the balance between theory and practice. Here I learned simple and natural ways of healing. With each new skill I learned, I would put it into practice. My first personal experience was with a man coming from a nearby village with severe back pain. After visiting many medical professionals, he could not find a way of healing. After a few sessions of treatment, his pain disappeared. Experiencing the miracle, he requested us to continue praying for him and his family. After graduation, I was invited to be a part of the physiotherapy team. My heart has received the peace that Jesus has promised. May the Lord guide you and He did for me, because now I know that I am in His mission field.
