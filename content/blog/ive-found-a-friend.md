*This story is told by Valerii, a graduate from the ACCESS School in Bulgaria











My wife and I are finishing the work in the fifth biggest city of Turkey. The population here is 2 million people. The weather is nice and warm most days out of the year. During our 2 month stay, we have met many friendly faces. We have made several contacts recently. These individuals have been open to hearing about health evangelism. Many people are turned off by religion. As we know, the health message is the entering wedge for gospel. We have found that massage treatments are quite effective. People are coming to us with pain and leaving rejuvenated. Slowly, their hearts are becoming ready for spiritual talks. We are making many friends wherever we go: at the market place, barber shops, bus etc. Prayer has been our main tool in reaching the people. Our prayer is that God will send us Divine appointments. I’d like to share an experience about a family we came in contact with. They shared Turkey’s history with us and explained that it was once a Christian nation. As the conversation progressed, we began talking about spiritual themes form the word of God. It was a blessed time of fellowship. After some time, when everyone left the room, I was alone with one of the men from this family. He expressed that he is a Christian, but in secret. As more people entered the room, the professed Christian changed the topic. It is nice to see how God is working with people. I can see that health evangelism is reaching souls for the Kingdom.
