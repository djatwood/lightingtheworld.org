### 2012 in Review

The work of LIGHT has experienced tremendous expansion and growth over the past couple of years with the number of countries entered and missionaries trained almost doubling every year! As we look back over 2012, we can see where the Lord moved in mighty ways to advance the proclamation of the Gospel through health evangelism.

The year 2012 saw:

*   Total number of medical missionaries  since LIGHT&#8217;s beginning now over 5000.
*   The training of over 90% of the Pastor&#8217;s in Guatemala in an abridged version of our Health Evangelism Course.
*   The partnership with the Health and Temperance leader for the NY 13 mission thrust of the General Conference for this upcoming summer.
*   The affiliation of three short term missionary training schools in Columbia, and the affiliation of Eden Valley&#8217;s new 6 Month Course called &#8220;The Well&#8221;.
*   We have begun to work the with the Amazon Lifesavers boat launch project to start a short term missionary training school for the large group of indigenous people group living in the Brazilian Amazon.
*   First six month schools in Indonesia with stellar result in reaching the Muslim communities.
*   The great success with the Muslim population throughout Central Asia via health evangelism.
*   The update and translation into spanish of our entire 1 month curriculum.
*   The completion of our LIGHT Studio, designed for the production of different methods and mediums of health evangelism training.

We are excited to see the fulfillment of these words,  &#8220;We shall see the medical missionary work broadening and deepening at every point of its progress, because of the inflowing of hundreds and thousands of streams, until the whole earth is covered as the waters cover the sea.&#8221; Medical Ministry, p. 317.

And we have greater hopes and aspirations for the year of 2013. Partner with us this year in advancing the work of the Three Angel&#8217;s Message through health evangelism.
