From May 11 through 20, 2015 the first 10 day program on healthful living took place at the Los Aromos Wellness Center. This is where Mr. Peter enters the scene, a man of almost 70 years of age with a solitary life and difficult past, with alcohol being his main companion during most of his life. He lives in Tome, in an area near Concepción, Chile.

Mr. Peter attended the program with the help of a social organization that helps people with difficulties, given that Mr. Peter had left drinking by his own decision a little while before, decided to send him to the program with the purpose of fortifying his decision to leave alcohol and form new health habits.

Mr. Peter arrived at Los Aromos Wellness Center with a surprised face, exploring with his eyes every corner and every expression of his hosts. He was timid yet participative, silent yet observant, with the desire to learn and be better. His major health problems were related to his use of alcohol for such a long period of time, his liver not working as well as it had before. He had alterations in the nerves in his legs and complained that his mind was cloudy. He couldn&#8217;t concentrate or retain information, his memory failed, especially as the day wore on. In the morning hours his mind was clearer&#8230;and it was then that God started to work in him.

The greater part of his long life, Mr. Peter believed that he wasn&#8217;t important to God, that God had no time for him, and that he wasn&#8217;t of any value. But the Lord who is all powerful works through simple remedies and through simple people that put themselves in his hands. These were the tools that God used to get to the heart of Mr. Peter: a simple, healthy, yet complete diet, water, exercise, fresh air, sunlight, rest, and the love and sympathy deomonstrated by the people at Los Aromos Wellness Center. Little things but that in the hands of the Lord produce great results.

Mr. Peter experienced a change, he felt different, his mind started to become &#8220;clearer&#8221; and felt God working on his heart. He understood the value he had in God&#8217;s eyes and his life had new meaning. He arrived in the program as a man that walked through life alone. He left the program with the best travel companion: God. Mr. Peter started to study the Bible and go to the Seventh-Day Adventist church in his vicinity and decided to give his life completely to God through baptism on October 10, 2015.

Mr. Peter is a living testimony, not only for those that hear his story, but also for the health professionals that assist him, because they see great changes in his body and mind. And God does a complete work, not only restoring the body, but healing the heart and giving new life.

Jesus said: &#8220;But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.&#8221; John 4:14
