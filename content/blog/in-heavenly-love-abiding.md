Grant was a studious individual who took school very seriously. In the evenings, he would study with his three friends. These friends happened to be Seventh-day Adventists. Grant, however, was not. Grant was the son of a Baptist pastor and had been raised in that religion all of his life. Interestingly enough, he had many questions about the Bible that remained unanswered. Grant&#8217;s friends brought him to meet Sam. Sam was a Bible worker in the local area.

When Grant&#8217;s friends took him to meet this fellow, almost immediately Grant started asking questions about the Sabbath. This opened the door to invite Grant to worship with them at church that coming Sabbath. Grant appreciated the beautiful truths that were taught that day. After church, Grant joined Sam and his friends for lunch that afternoon. Grant asked many more questions which led to several Bible studies. After a while, Grant started attending church every Saturday. Even though Grant was raised as a Christian, he was not living a Christian life. He had not fully understood what God was asking of him. This led to more bible studies and sleepless nights full of prayer. After 6 months of intense study, Grant was baptized into the Seventh-day Adventist church. Soon afterwards, he decided to take a light training course that was taking place in his local community.
