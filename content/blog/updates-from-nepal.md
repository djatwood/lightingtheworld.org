Graduation was finished! Early in the morning a big group of young ladies and some of the staff headed off to their homes in Udeypur. Later after breakfast another group headed back to their homes in India. I, too, was headed to India but was not yet ready. I quickly packed up and gave last directions, then I, too, headed for the border. The last group to go to Kathmandu followed a little while later as they had to catch the night bus. We were a little late but the Lord helped us to get to the home of one of my students before night.  

I must needs be out of the country for a little while as my visa was expired for the time being. This gave me the opportunity to visit a number of places that had been calling me for some time. God also added a couple more on the way. I was not sure how long I needed to be gone and so day by day I was asking God, “Now what would You like me to do?” Part way through it became evident that I needed to go south for a couple of weeks. Because of the need to book train tickets I had a schedule for a little while. Many days on my journey I wouldn’t know the day before where I would need to go the next day.

God used me in a number of ways. In Megalaya at Bill Dull’s school, Springs of Love, I was able to help them with teaching the high school students and their teachers First Aid. It was lots of work but fun and rewarding as well. I hope it will be a lifesaver to many. A number of the young people there approached me asking if there was any way they could come to take our courses. The young people saw the graduates from our courses who were there taking midwifery and the young intern with me and saw a real difference with them and wanted the same for themselves. I was so happy to see these young people standing up for the truth and being a real tasty ‘salty’ flavor to the group. (Matt. 5:13)

Then the Advanced Tailoring course was to begin. One of the young ladies from Assam had no one to travel with her. So we caught the train to pick her up. We were able to meet many of the Seminary graduates and other students that had returned home after their courses were finished. It was so nice to see them happy, busy teaching Gideon teaching Bible classes others what they had learned. Rakesh and Gideon had started a home church in their village and want to get a church built on some land that has been donated for a church. A number of young people also want to come from the areas around there for upcoming courses for men and women. These young people who have returned from our center have been a good witness for God and the truth. Please keep them in your prayers that they may be faithful.

Reshma, the young lady I had come to pick up, was from another faith. We met her at her home and saw how God had protected her family a couple of days before she returned. A large tree fell on her house at night but only crushed the room that no one was in (newly repaired in the photo)! God is so merciful!

A couple of days later the Advanced Tailoring began. God heard your prayers and all ten young ladies were able to come back and take the Advanced Tailoring. They are a precious group. Young and very spiritual and talented. God has great plans for them. Seth started them in right away with the hardest item, pants, to finish mastering. On the side they also were learning to stitch and design long skirts. It was so good to see their progress.  

This course also has included math (because tailoring, using formulas, needs a lot of math), Bible classes on the Life of Christ and the Great Controversy, English, and Revelation. Some girls are also trying to learn guitar. So they are busy and happy. My travels continued to take one of the graduates, Karuna, down to a new job helping a widow in South India. On the way we stopped at Springs of Joy and were happy to be reunited with the Pozo family. God is blessing their ministry there and they are of good courage. I also got a little chance to get more practice in midwifery which I had desired to get for some time. It was a blessing to learn so much in just a week’s time.  

As I brought Karuna down to her new family I was happy to see her standing for what she had learned. The family she has gone to help are in much need and I pray she will be a light and strength to them. Returning I spent the weekend with another of my graduates who is now married to the Indian AFCOE leader. I praise the Lord I was able to share a lot with her on child care from God’s word and to see how eager she was to put it into practice.  

With visa challenges and seeing how well our team is caring for the Advanced Tailoring course I felt God opened a little window for me to get a little time to refresh my knowledge and be a blessing to another training institute. So this led me to come back to the States for a few months to help in the Educational Department of Uchee Pines where I had originally been trained. I pray I may use this time wisely to get strong in health, spiritually and refresh my knowledge and bless many other young people. I am still in close contact with what is going on back in Nepal and will keep you updated.
