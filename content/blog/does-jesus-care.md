*This is told in the perspective of Ron and Carin Lynch, our new North America Directors.











God’s timing is always perfect. It’s so amazing when He schedules a Divine appointment. Just last weekend we accompanied Pablo and Linda Betancurt to a Spanish church in Port Charlotte, Florida for a health emphasis weekend. Ron taught a few of the 8 laws of health and I presented a cooking class. After the worship service, I met a young woman Alex who was from Miami, Fl. She drove with friends 3 hours to attend the church trainings. We enjoyed great conversation about medical missionary work during the fellowship luncheon.  When Alex found out I was presenting a cooking class the next day, she shared with me that her step-father did some cooking classes as well. She asked me if I had ever heard of Julio Barillas. My reply… “Do you mean Chef Julio Barillas”? She excited said “Yes, do you know of him”?  I said to her, let me tell you a story. About a week ago I was talking to my husband and stated to him that I wasn’t sure if I would ever be in contact with Chef Julio again on this earth, but if not, when I get to Heaven, I must thank him for being such an inspiration to me. Due to his passion for health ministry and amazing presentations of the health message, I began to present cooking classes in my home church and ultimately committed my life to serving the Lord in full time ministry. That was over 12 years ago.  Alex picked up her phone and Chef Julio and I reunited through a video chat and I was able to personally thank him for allowing the Lord to use him because he made a difference in my life.

One Divine appointment is great, but two are even better.  The day after I returned from Florida, I reached out to a contact in Canada who is interested in having LIGHT present a training at his church. As we spoke on the phone, Marcelo expressed to me that he and his wife want to do full-time medical missionary work; however, with 2 young children they don’t know how to get stared or manage.   He saw a testimony of a family who began full time ministry and he was so inspired by their story that he has been trying to contact this man but has had no success.  He shared with me that they run a Lifestyle center in Bolivia.  I asked, by chance is this man named Dr. Kim? He excitedly told me yes and stated  “ Do you know him”?.  My reply… “I don’t know him personally, but I am well acquainted with his son, Benjamin Kim, the Media director for LIGHT and I’m pretty sure he can connect you with Dr. Kim.” Marcelo said this was a true answer to prayer. God never ceases to amaze us.
