They accomplish this through: a lifestyle center, a 9 month Medical Missionary training course, a primary school, an homeless outreach center (named _Isaiah 58_), a Drug Rehabilitation Center and their evangelism team. The group travels all over Colombia as _Health Evangelists_ and consists of eight people with the clear goal of establishing permanent centers of influence through the starting of bakeries and other similar ministries. This fall I had the privilege of spending a couple of weeks at this amazing project teaching some Bible classes to the 55 passionate students, eating with several of the optimistic patients and speaking with the staff on various occasions. So let me tell you a little bit about some of their newest projects.

It is a project that began several months ago with the focus on feeding the homeless and clothing the less fortunate. Every day of the week (including weekends), there is a group that drives down with fresh produce directly from their garden situated on the side of a hill, surrounded by the foothills of the Andes mountains. In the morning after breakfast, the group takes the produce down to the Isaiah 58 center in town with several students and volunteers. They open up the center and divide the work, then they begin with the day’s activities. Some start preparing lunch-peeling, chopping, cooking, and the like- while others go around cleaning. A little later when the people begin to arrive, they offer them breakfast and some matts to sleep or rest on the floor. When they spot a person with ragged or dirty clothes, they will offer them a replacement depending on what they have available in their clothes room, they are also given the opportunity to take a shower and wash their clothes if they so desire. Closer to noon, the kitchen group will usually eat lunch while someone greets those coming in and has a short worship with them which includes singing and possibly a testimony or a Bible verse. Upon finishing with the worship, they are sent upstairs in groups to be served lunch. After finishing lunch, the group cleans up and everyone leaves the center, waiting for the following day to start the process all over again.

May God bless this project and all those living to serve others. But the question still stands, what are you doing to further God&#8217;s kingdom and show God&#8217;s love to those around you? Is there something similar that you can do in your community?
