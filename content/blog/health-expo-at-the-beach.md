We arrived in Chile in the middle of their summer. To me it felt like the beginning of Fall. Every one around me spoke Spanish. I was thankful for Elena Rivas who accompanied me to Chile and translated conversations as well as the class material for me. Our accommodation was in the hills of Origenes in Algarrobo The home of Rene Lefimil is situated in a valley surrounded by more than 250 fruit, nuts, grape vine bushes and a garden on 5 hecter acres in the country.

Rene (our host) took the training given by LIGHT 2 years ago. He caught the vision for the medical missionary work and went about renovating his home to start a school and a sanitarium where people can come to learn about health and healing physically and spiritually. The home is spacious and will be able to accommodate students who are willing to be trained as medical missionaries; the idea is to train them to be able to work on the farm and in the lifestyle center so they can gain practical experience.

At the culmination of the one month school we held a Health Expo at the beach. Linda Horner’s one-month school from Los Aromos joined our students, and together we had over 150 attendees,who were there to enjoy the sunlight and the beach, what a moment! We had a small but eager group of 15 students whose testimony in the end was heartfelt, inspiring and encouraging.

As I travel from county to country and teach the students, I realize more and more the need for the medical missionary work for this time. We are thankful for the Conference, working with the churches to host the LIGHT training around the world. Since we left, many health expos have been conducted by Rene and the students. We praise God that the work is continuing in Chile.
