For the last six months, our family has been serving as medical missionaries in a foreigner country. Many people are sick and searching for healing from God’s natural pharmacy. This opens the door for sharing the Gospel.  

Three weeks ago, I met a new family. A week before this, I had prayed to God that He would use me as a blessing in someone’s life. One day, I went into a shop. While talking with a consultant who worked there, the director of the establishment approached me with some questions. He asked: “Where are you from? Who are you? Your accent is different.” After a short talk, he asked me to help some of his relatives who have a son who is handicapped (about 30 years old), who was ill. I agreed to see this man and give him whatever relief I could. For thirteen days, I was giving hydrotherapy treatments, followed by a deep relaxing massage.

I always started with prayer. However, on the first day of our treatment, the reaction to the prayer invitation was difficult to understand. When I had started my plea to the Lord, the young man began laughing loudly during the whole prayer. We prayed in the name of Jesus Christ for his spiritual and physical healing – and to my surprise, the next day, the young man did not laugh anymore. Massage and hydrotherapy helped him a lot and the family asked me to come to their home once a week to continue with the massage. Through the sickness of this young man, God offered an opportunity for the whole family to receive salvation. Please pray that they will accept the Gospel.
