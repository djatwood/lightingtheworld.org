It’s been almost three weeks since Miriam, Krisztina and I started working at the local Adventist School here in Gimbi,Ethiopia.  

The conditions at the school here are completely different from Adventist schools back in Europe. We were amazed when we learned that each class has about 80 students on average and that students sit in one classroom throughout the morning with only 15 minutes of break for the whole day. There are no practical classes, and even their IT classes are given in the same classroom because there are no computers for the students to work on.  

The thing that was the most disappointing for us was to learn that the students currently receive no religious education. There is no prayer or devotional time with the students. Having learned and experienced the tremendous blessing of true education at TGM and other Adventist schools, we all felt so sad that this school was hardly any different from a government school.
