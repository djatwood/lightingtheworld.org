We have been running the Health Essential training for lay members in the North East Nigeria Conference in collaboration with the Conference since February and so for we have covered the first 3 modules of the Health Essential Course in 3 Centers, training **over 130** people with the numbers increasing with each module.  

We are very excited because there is a great awakening here regarding the Medical Missionary Work &#8211; the right arm of the the 3 Angels&#8217; message. More than 50 of our students are already going from church to church giving health talks, checking vital signs and running health expos as part of their practicals.  

The Conference Health director Mrs Afiniki Lazarus a top Government instructor for Nurses and Midwifes in the Jos University Teaching Hospital, is full of praises to God for restoring her full health since adopting the health reform principles and she is already sharing it with Nurses and Midwives training under her.  

Next weekend, we are commencing the last module rotationally across the 3 centers which will take us to October 17, at the end of which most of our students will be graduated.  

We are also very excited to let you know that a sister Conference &#8211; North West Nigeria Conference is also showing interest for us to extend to their Conference. I spoke to the Health director there last week, he wants us to meet to discuss the logistics for the program.

&#8211; Manoah, West Africa Regional Director
