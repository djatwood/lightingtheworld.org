We had a good opening there through one believer who is very interested in our program. most of the staff and Students nearly 20 of us went there to conduct the weekend program and health expo program on sunday. most of them were teachers in the school. Many of the teachers and the Principal who is also the pastor took a stand that we will not part take of things that are injurious to the health. Nearly more than 150 people in the church and more than 200 people came for the camp.

Praising God for using us for his glory,  

Joshua Subhash
