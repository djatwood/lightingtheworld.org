This is a testimony from one of our contacts during our visit. Her name is Lucy. She is a Sunday keeper. Stays with her sister who is a retired nurse. When we met her, we were concerned with the nasty wound in her leg. When we asked her the cause she say she was bitten by a poisonous spider. She went to hospital but it was all in vain. The doctors were not able to treat it. Lucy has been with that wound for few months without hope. The sister has tried and she has failed. The wound has worsened up to an extent the room where she stays is smelly.

We started cleaning it around the 15th of March 2020, using different types of simple remedies; charcoal, hydrogen peroxide, salt etc. we thank God very much the wound is showing a sign of healing. The sister is amazed to see a big change in her sister. There is no smell at this time all the dirty dead tissues and pus is gone.  Lucy is very happy and she is looking forward when she will be healed fully through Gods power.
