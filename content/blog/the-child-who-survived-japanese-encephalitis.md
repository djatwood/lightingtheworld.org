One of our dear patient was a 5-year-old Hindu girl who survived Japanese encephalitis, but looked more like a vegetable after they brought her home from the hospital. Alisha, our seminary student and her therapist, will tell you more: “During outreach we found a young family with 3 children. Five months ago a terrible disease almost killed their daughter. It was a miracle that she survived, but she lost her speech and had no reaction in her sight. They were giving her only cow’s milk to drink instead of food because she was unable to chew and swallow.

We decided to help this Hindu family. Ankita and her mother were with us during the last 2 months. Her father used to come and help, as well. We knew that much time would be needed for her full recovery. Sister Tanya talked with the mother about the importance of hope, courage, long suffering and much much love to be shown to the child. We told them about the right diet, the importance of water and sunshine. They were doing their best and we helped them provide healthy food, soya milk, rice water.










“The Saviour&#8217;s work was not restricted to any time or place. His compassion knew no limit.”  

Ministry Healing p17










Her treatment was: warm bath (with salt, ginger, turmeric), gentle massage and motion exercises. At the same time we were teaching the mother, so she could continue with the treatmentat home. I was so happy because we could pray with them. They even visited our Sabbath worship. Many of their relatives came and saw this Christian school and the miracle that God is doing in Ankita’s life. Today she is much much better: she reacts at questions, her eyes shine, she started crying loud (not talking yet). She also started eating normal food because she learned to chew and swallow again. The parents are happy.
