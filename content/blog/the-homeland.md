&#8220;Great and marvelous are Your works, Lord God Almighty! Just and true are Your ways, O King of the saints! Who shall not fear You, O Lord, and glorify Your name? For you alone are Holy. For all nations shall come and worship before You.&#8221;  

Revelations 15: 3-4.










The year 2016 was another year that we would, by all means, give praises to the Almighty God for His divine mercies and providence. Being entrusted with the responsibilities of educating and preparing men and women for the final crisis can be very challenging and fascinating. Only when we realize that our duties are privileges, and the right is His to lead and direct human minds to His own revelations, we shall be humble instruments in His hands.

We were blessed with full classes with an overflow of students, ages between 17 through 64, from all over the country. Some students were people with experience, others growing and still others meeting the realities of this calling for the first time.

We were encouraged to have had some field experiences where students went to do personal, door to door labor and public preaching in two sites (Njojo and Ilasa). Even though the circumstances were challenging, we praise the Lord that 6 souls gave their lives to Jesus and were baptized.

Community services highlighted the door to door activities and opened the hearts of many villagers as they witnessed helping hands reaching out and blessing them. Medical missionary activities accompanied the community services. Those in need were served as we were able, each according to their needs. Several health expos were conducted and the response was overwhelming. Opportunities were opened to help those in need by spending one-on-one time with these individuals. Our camp sites were always full of people needing God’s blessings and the team did whatever could be done to relieve them.

In both villages, the government officers spoke highly of the spirit manifested by our teams, especially for setting a good example of hygiene, relations, hard work and for making the gospel become a reality and not just a theory.

Invitations were given to us to go and share in the divine services at Njojo with Mwalimu Baraka Kabonge presenting touching sermons. This raised a lot of interest from the church pastor and her members desiring for continued studies for a deeper walk with our Lord, and understanding His Word.

It’s been a blessing working with churches with a vision, who understood their mission, and whose members are active in evangelism. Churches whose members have burdens for souls and are not coerced to witnessing, but who realize it’s a personal responsibility and love to do so from the bottom of their hearts.

As we were ending the year, the conference leadership came requesting if we could provide them with committed, well able men who can be used by them, as the need for lay pastors is growing. The conference leadership also expressed appreciation for the training given by Kibidula in training workers for the Lord, and that they have witnessed how many of our graduates are really experiences. We are encouraged by their support and measurement, plus the cooperation in our midst. What a blessing it is to be in such a state of relations.










&#8220;_Humble workers, who do not trust in their own strength, but who labor in simplicity, trusting always in God, will share in the joy of the Saviour. Their persevering prayers will bring souls to the cross. In their cooperation with their self-sacrificing efforts Jesus will move upon the hearts, working miracles in the conversion of souls. Men and women will be gathered into church fellowship. Meetinghouses will be built and schools established. The hearts of the workers will be filled with joy as they see the salvation of God_&#8221;  

7T 26-28.










Again this year, 2017, the Lord has blessed us with another full class. May He help us to be humble for trusting us with this sacred responsibility, that we be wise in sharing the light we have. Continue to pray for us and for our students that they may be better representatives of Heaven, wherever they will be.
