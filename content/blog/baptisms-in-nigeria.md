I want to thank you so much for your prayers during the 2 weeks evangelism that ended last sabbath at Andaha- Nasarawa state.  

We give glory to God for the privilege of sharing his word with many from that community, every night we had the average attendance of about 100 people, about 40 every night were non SDAs. 14 initially indicated their interest in baptism but after coming under pressure from their families and churches only 7 were able to withstand the pressure because they were all young between the ages of 17 and 25.  

The 7 were baptized Sabbath morning before the Devine service. Keep them up in your prayers.  

Find attached a few pictures from their baptism, we give glory to God for His grace.
