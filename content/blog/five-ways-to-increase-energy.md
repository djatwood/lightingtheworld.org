Energy is essential for life—it is what empowers us to think, move, love, and live. So we might all be interested to know how we can build more and better energy. To find answers, let’s first take a look at some basic physiology.

### How Does the Body Make Energy?

Inside most of our body’s cells are miniscule “power plants” called mitochondria. Usually rod-shaped, these tiny chambers are filled with electronic and chemical machinery encased by a double membrane. Mitochondria’s main job is to convert food energy into body energy. They take the glucose absorbed from the carbohydrates that we eat and produce energy molecules called ATP (adenosine triphosphate). The mitochondria can also utilize fatty acids from stored fat or body fat. Each cell can contain approximately one billion ATP molecules, and these invaluable molecules are the major energy currency used to fuel thousands of chemical reactions occurring within our bodies. They also provide the electrical energy to run our nervous system, thermal energy to warm or cool the body, and the mechanical energy to do actual physical work.

Each primed cell should have millions of ATP molecules all ready for action. When ATP is used up, it becomes ADP (adenosine diphosphate). These degraded molecules can be recycled back, by the faithful mitochondria, into fresh ATP that is ready once again to supply more energy.

### Importance of Mitochondria

Obviously, the mitochondria are vital for optimal energy production and overall wellbeing. Likewise, their malfunction can significantly contribute to several serious conditions and diseases. Under-standing these cause-to-effect relationships can help us to avoid practices that would damage our energy production and compromise our health.

### Mitochondria and Disease

In hypertensive patients, there are mitochondrial dysfunctions in the brain, kidneys, liver, and heart tissues. In the case of type 2 diabetes, the mitochondria in the skeletal muscles are deficient in size. Thus any subsequent damage to these mitochondria further impairs the ability of cells to dispose of glucose and fats effectively, resulting in even higher elevated blood sugar levels.

### What Can Damage Mitochondria?

Mitochondria, as found in skeletal muscle, heart muscle, brain, and liver tissues, are very susceptible to lifestyle influences, including the following:

*   Obesity. Being significantly overweight may contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction in the heart and skeletal muscles, because excess weight reduces the ability of the mitochondria to burn fat.
*   Sugar and fat. Any diet that is too high in these macronutrients will eventually lead to an impaired function of the mitochondria.
*   Fried foods. The frequent consumption of such foods results in damage to the outer membrane of the mitochondria in brain cells. When this occurs, free radicals, which are utilized for energy production within the mitochondria, leak out and damage the brain’s nerve cells!
*   Dehydration. Lack of adequate water intake decreases the efficiency of mitochondria in the brain. In other words, if you don’t drink enough water, your thinking can be hampered!
*   Prenatal vitamin D deficiency can adversely affect mitochondria performance in brain cells.
*   Chronic alcohol consumption. Besides damaging mitochondrial DNA, alcohol use inhibits the ability of special enzymes that are programmed to repair DNA damage found on the nucleus of mitochondria.
*   Smoking. This damages the mitochondria in the heart.
*   Statins. Drugs designed to lower cholesterol levels, such as Lipitor and Zocor, can damage the mitochondria in the skeletal muscles.

As the proverb states, we generally reap what we sow. So, just as harmful lifestyle practices prove detrimental to mitochondria, healthful habits can improve their performance.

### Ways to Increase Energy:

Vigorous exercise benefits not only the skeletal muscles but can increase the relative number and volume of the mitochondria in the heart muscle and brain, as well! In other words, the number of mitochondria you have depends upon your recent physical activity. And the more power plants that you have, the more energy your body can produce, and the better you will feel. Note, too, that the mitochondria receive an increased boost if you exercise outside in the fresh air and sunshine. Thus, working or exercising in the fresh air with its electrified oxygen is more beneficial than indoors at a gym.

Animal studies suggest that exercise training can also reduce oxidative stress in the livers of emotionally-disturbed rodents. In this case, oxidative stress refers to a condition in which the liver generates more destructive free radicals than it has antioxidant capacity to handle. This is important to know, as excess free radicals can damage the double membranes of mitochondria, setting the stage for undesirable effects in surrounding tissue.

Regular serious exercise not only builds cellular energy but improves higher levels of efficiency of the mind and soul as well, thus achieving integrated vitalization for the whole person. There is much more than just cellular biology involved in enjoying wholistic energy. Remember, “The joy of the Lord shall be your strength.” True abundant energy is derived vertically from Omnipotence—from a God-centered focus rather than a self-centered or materialistic one.

Wise caloric restriction improves mitochondrial performance in brown adipose tissue* and in brain, muscle, and kidney cells. By increasing mitochondrial biogenesis while decreasing oxidative stress in the mitochondria, this progressive temperate eating proves a real winner.

The phytochemical resveratrol also increases the number of mitochondria. Resveratrol is found in peanuts, blueberries, and red or dark-colored grapes.

_“He [the Creator] gives power to the weak, and to those who have no might He increases strength. Even the youths shall faint and be weary, and the young shall utterly fall, but those who wait on the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings like eagles, they shall run and not be weary, they shall walk and not faint.” (Isaiah 40:29-31 NKJV)_

### Conclusion

For a happy and successful life, everybody needs plenty of energy. Having abundant energy requires diligence in following sound lifestyle habits, including regular exercise, moderate eating of wholesome food, sufficient sleep, and regularity of schedule. Abundant whole-person energy is based on our full cooperation with the loving and omnipotent Source of all energy.
