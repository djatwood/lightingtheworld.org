Committed to fulfilling the great commission of Jesus Christ as given in Matthew 28:18-20, there are several overseas mission facilities that work in cooperation with LIGHT ministry to spread the good news of the gospel.

When Students from these facilities go on outreach, they meet with many different people with a host of various health problems. Every day, they endeavor to help with advice on lifestyle changes as well as teaching them how to apply the natural remedies they themselves have been learning.

On outreach one day, our student Luke found a man named Sam, a 40 year old Hindu believer that has been working hard his whole life. When Luke found him, he was laying outside a thin, powerless man. He was unable to serve himself and, due to the fact his family worked all day, there was no one to help him. He therefore was not able to get the proper food, neither was there a water source near by for him to drink from. So they decided to treat Sam in the Hydro room for a period of 10 days.

Sam arrived on December 2nd, 2015, and we started by explaining to him the NEWSTART program. We also explained to him the treatments he would be receiving on a daily basis, such as Fomentations, hot tub bath, and trigger points massage. From the very first day of physiotherapy, he was able to stand and walk alone without assistance, and from then on we could see improvements daily on our very thankful patient. After just one week, he was able to use his right arm and hand again. Sam was with us at the campus church for two Sabbaths, taking manna for his soul. It was a blessing to see him walking home without the need of anyone’s assistance after the treatments were over.

Pray for Sam as well as the many others who are visited daily by these students. Also pray for guidance and protection of the 50 students at this LIGHT project.
