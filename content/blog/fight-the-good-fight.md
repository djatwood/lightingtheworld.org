*This is told in the perspective of a LIGHT worker in the Philippines.










Three weeks have passed since five students and six volunteers got deployed to two different locations in the northern part of Luzon. One group was deployed to Pangasinan and the other group to the Quirino province. As I update their journey and their experiences, I am inspired to know how two totally different situations can bring a lot of blessings to them, to the people they are ministering to, and to me. In Pangasinan, they were tasked to join the two-week evangelistic effort at the local church and visit people for updates and follow ups. They have no problem in regards to food, accommodation, water supply, and their relationship with the brethren of the church.

“The students and the volunteers are enjoying mission work to its fullest extent. We have seen the LORD working not only in us but through us,” said one volunteer. On the other hand, the students and volunteers deployed in Quirino province have a totally opposite situation. They are situated in the mountain which is an hour hike for beginners. They don’t have good accomodations. The have no shower, which is why they go down the river (a fifteen-minute walk) to wash, take a bath, and do their business. One student deployed in Quirino shared, “It was a struggle at first, I wanted to go back to Nueva Era immediately to wash my clothes and myself properly. However, as I saw people hungering for Christ and His Word, I was encouraged to continue on amidst the difficult situation we were facing. Now that we are almost done, I am wanting to stay longer.”

We are soliciting your prayers for the souls they are ministering to, so that the seed of truth being planted in their hearts will grow and flourish. We praise the LORD for the amazing journey our missionaries are experiencing in the field. Two weeks still remain for their mission trip. We are excited to learn and hear more testimonies when they come back for their graduation. Maranatha!
