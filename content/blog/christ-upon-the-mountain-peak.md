*Names have been changed to protect the identities of the individuals in this story*.










After returning from our vacation, John and I took one of the students to the training location to care for the center and do field work in the community. At night, we couldn&#8217;t sleep well since those on night duty around our place in the government buildings were often shouting to one another. We had heard from our landlord that terrorists were roaming around and that we should keep our lights on until the morning. We periodically woke up to check on our things. It is difficult to share the gospel because people are concerned only on their temporal benefits and not on the things of God. We want to share our LIGHT with people who are interested.  

Keep us in your prayers as we seek to find individuals who are really seeking truth.  

The story is not finished, for only God knows the end. After staying in our friend’s training center, we needed to return to Nepal. Here, we tried our best to fit three training programs in a small village space. The Evangelism students, who were refugees from the landslides in the mountains, added to the Advanced tailoring program. The evangelism students were on the front porch, and the Advanced Tailoring group sat on the back porch while the Seminary students stayed in the office. Though quarters were cramped, God’s grace was sufficient.

Soon, the weather cleared up and the backhoe started up the mountain clearing up the way. After a few days, motorcycles started to move again and they said it should be opened in two days. So, our Evangelism team left their luggage behind hoping to see it in a couple of days. A couple of days turned into two weeks. We hope that everything can go up soon. Keep us very much in prayer. This week, there will be a special training. Please keep this, the challenges in the mountain and our seminary program in special prayer. The strike still is not open. We know God has special plans for us.
