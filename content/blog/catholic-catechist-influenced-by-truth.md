On Monday 17 June 2013, Francis Nyabuto, a staunch Catholic catechist,  

came to do some cement flooring work for us. He joined and observed  

morning and evening worship, eating, dressing, praying, relating with  

each other and planning our days.  

He came with many questions regarding the Sabbath day, praying through  

Mary, baptism – is it sprinkling, pouring or what? And more. We  

showed him some video’s and gave Bible studies to answer some  

questions. Afterwards he said that baptism that it should be in much  

water and wishes the Catholic priests would do so and started to pray  

to God through Jesus Christ and not Mary. He admits the Sabbath is  

the seventh day and not Sunday. He has accepted Jesus as his personal  

savior. Praise God!  

He went to church with us on Sabbath and he wants himself and his  

family to go to the Seventh-day Adventist Church. His wife Nyaboke  

was formerly a SDA who joined Catholicism when she married him.  

Please pray for Francis regarding the following: understanding God’s  

Word; knowing the truth and following it; being a witness to his  

family and Catholic friends; that his wife Nyaboke will accept the  

truth and return to the SDA church and that they will both be baptized  

in Jesus’ way.
