*This is told in the perspective of Ron and Carin Lynch, LIGHT’s North American Directors.









2019 began an inspiring journey that has taken us as far west as Albuquerque, New Mexico and as far east as Baltimore, Maryland. In the last 4 months, we have attended the NAD Health Summit, ministered to 1 conference (6 churches were in attendance). We also held presentations at a Health Retreat for over 100 non-Seventh-day Adventists.  It has already been a tremendous year for the North American Division.  At the NAD Health Summit, we had the privilege of speaking with Elder Ted Wilson, the General Conference President. Elder Wilson recognized and praised LIGHT’s global work for the church. To God be the glory!

Our prayers for the Lord to open doors for us has been answered.  As of now, we are booked through the end of 2019 and have 6 tentative bookings for 2020. In addition, we have 4 bookings this year to present additional seminars that will act as a follow-up to our presentations that were held in 2018. This has resulted in the expansion of our workshop subjects and have incorporated new topics such as “Outreach”, “Finishing the Work” and “God’s Will in Your Life”.

In the United States and Canada, our focus is to revive the church and inspire the members to embrace health evangelism as the opening wedge to finish the work in their own community.  We primarily present 3-day, 5-day and 10-day programs to meet the needs of the individual churches. We hope to ultimately direct them to the “Essentials of Health Evangelism” online training to further educate them in medical missionary work.
