As told by Serghei Costas, Europe Division Director










Thirty-seven-year-old Larisa lives in Moldova with her husband, Nicolae and two daughters, Daniela and Ekaterina. In 2018 she was diagnosed with cancer. A few months later, she was admitted to an oncological hospital in Chișinău, Moldova’s capital city. The doctors examined her and found she had heart issues due to complications caused by the cancer. After that, she suffered from lung problems. When doctors examined her again, they said that the cancer had metastasized and that it was terminal. By April 2019, Larisa had a breathing mechanism installed.

Larisa’s condition was so bad that doctors said that she would live no longer than 3 days. The doctors gave her morphine to try lessen the pain. Larisa and confused and disorientated and tried to commit suicide and few times. Her relatives asked the doctors to arrange her discharge so she could go home. Larisa’s relatives came to say goodbye. However, Larisa did not agree with all these arrangements – she did not want to die.

Larisa came to a health center where LIGHT was preparing a medical missionary program. A Christian atmosphere, simple remedies, special diet, and being continually surrounded with prayer helped her day by day to become better. In the beginning, she was slowly walking short distances. After one week, she was able to easily walk more than 1 kilometer (0.6 miles). Larisa decided to make a new choice in her life &#8211; to know more about God. Pastor Igor, a medical missionary student at the health center, gave Larisa Bible studies. Now she is preparing to be baptized. In August 2019, Larisa went for a checkup and the doctors was surprised to see her alive.

They called other doctors to come and look. Everyone was interested in what she was doing. That was when Larisa shared how great God is. She declared that His remedies are the way to help people. In Larisa’s eyes, the greatest miracle is not the regression of the cancer, but her step of faith to meet Christ.
