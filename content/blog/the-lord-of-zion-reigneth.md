* This is written in the perspective of Cynthia Bonas, along with her wonderful team, which consisted of: Grace Walsh, Pastor Lambert (from England), Catherine , Geoffrey  Mbozi (from Zambia)*











For several months, we have been planning on going to Zambia to conduct a LIGHT school. As the time drew nearer, plans changed. There was an evangelistic series that was entitled, “Zambia For Christ”, which was being conducted around the same time we would be conducting the school. We thought it was better to postpone the school until a later date. However, God worked things out so that both programs took place without any interruptions.  

Classes were held at the Lusaka Central SDA church in Zambia.  

Our classes had to be adjusted to work around the evangelistic meetings, so we had the first 2 weeks of classes in the evening and the second 2 weeks were held in the morning.  In this way, there was no conflict with the students wanting to attend both programs.

In the end, we had 80 graduates. Some students joined late, because of other commitments. The classes were lively and interactive.  

Over one hundred and fifty individuals attended the health expo.  

Before we arrived in Zambia, our team was asked to present health talks to various professional groups in Zambia.  

We were invited to attend the 2018 Chief Officer Conference and present health topics on heart disease, hypertension and stress.  

The CEO of the company was present and said how much he enjoyed our presentations.  He said at lunch time, the hotel was short on vegetables, because the participants chose more vegetables with their meal after listening to our presentations.  

 He requested more health presentations in the future.  The health and temperance department will follow up with this request.

Our next two presentations were for the Zambian Judiciaries.  

In attendance were:  

Honourable  Justice Hildah Chibomba, The Judge President, The Constitutional Court of Zambia  

Honourable Justice F. Chisanga, The Judge President, The Court of Appeal  

Honourable Justices of the Constitutional Court and Court of Appeal

The topics presented included heart disease, hypertension, stress and the 8 LAWS of health as it relates to disease.  

These are also some of the leading causes of health problems in Zambia.  

In the end, they also asked if they could have more information.  

Each group was given free books. They also purchased many books on health that were on sale at each site.

Our team was able to enjoy two beautiful outings. One was going to the Riverside Sanitarium in Zambia. It was great to see the work God is doing at the sanitarium. Next, was visiting Victoria Falls. This is one of God’s masterpieces. Phenomenal!  

There is a great need for the members to be trained in medical missionary work. Continue to pray for the students who are interested in taking the 6-month online course.
