*This is told in the perspective of Serghei Costash, the Euro-Mena Divisional Director.










In April, ACCESS joined with ADRA in Bulgaria to organize a health expo in the center of a city called &#8220;Nova Zagora&#8221;. We were intensely involved in serving at the stands, offering free massages and listening to stories of those who were suffering. A week after this project, ACCESS, in collaboration with the COI in Nova Zagora, organized a weekly health club. We were praying before the first meeting for at least 10 people to be in attendance. To our delight, 24 came. And this number varied between 20-30 participants during the last 9 weeks. Our first 6 meetings were introducing the guests into the world of natural remedies. Then we started a series of cooking classes.

Our main goal of success was found in Christ’s method. By providing for the people, we established great friendships. Some of them approached us to ask for prayer support, while others invited us to their homes to meet their families. There were even a few ladies who brought clothes that we could share during our trips to poor countries in Africa and Asia.

Those in attendance are now aware that Seventh-day Adventists are truly living out their faith as stated in the song: “We are His hands, to touch the world around us. We are His feet, to go where He may lead”  

Now, most people are on vacation. However, we plan on continuing the club after August with new topics, new speakers and new friends.

The success we have seen in this health club has been an answer to 2 years of fervent prayer by our team and the local church. Praise the Lord for His many blessings.
