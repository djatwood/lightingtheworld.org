*This is told in the perspective of Pastor Tolentino, a LIGHT worker in Southeast Asia.











Before leaving earth, Jesus commissioned His disciples; “Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name  

 of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: Teaching them  to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and lo, I am with you always even unto the end of the world. Amen.” Matthew 28:19, 20. Christ was our example in every way, as a church we are  founded in His word and we follow His examples: that’s our mission – to reflect His character in our life.

Be Involved: this has more bad connotations rather than  positive ones. The word involved is usually being associated to people who are being dragged to bad situations like crimes and  such. Nonetheless, for batch 19 Medical Missionary graduates, it’s more of developing  preaching, teaching, and healing skills as means of reaching the people. We ought to be involved in the end-time work and to proclaim the good news of salvation, following Jesus’ great commission before leaving earth. Being involved, for batch 19, is  involving yourself in this wonderful mission of saving the lost.

The batch 19, started as a small group at first until they were completed at the number of 11. Their history unfolded January 9, 2018; during  the 2nd week of the one month evangelism of the batch 18. They came from different places, different training grounds, and family background with different trials and ambitions in life. Then in their  busy life, the Lord cared to call them into His vineyard to win souls for the Kingdom!

Struggles came along the way especially during their last weeks in the campus before they were sent outside for their one-month mission trip. There were many issues and problems in their batch that tested their faith as individuals. No one to cling on to but the Lord who understands every trial that comes along the way. These trials did not hinder them to continue on their journey. 

With 11 at the start, Batch 19 ended with the perfect number 7: one of the fewest number of trainees in a batch ever. January 28, marked the beginning of their real journey as medical missionaries. They gladly reported their experiences during their one month mission trip in Isabela and Badoc in Sabbath School. They were amazed at  how faithful God was during their journey as they have experienced applying the things they have learned during the training. Visitors from their respective deployment area also came to support them in their special day.

Pastor Edgar Bryan Tolentino, the director of Ellen White Estate Philippines was the guest speaker for the graduation. For his message, he shared how important it is not just to be involved in the end-time work but to be involved in a relationship to the Savior. In his charge, he appealed to everyone that our works will not save us but it is only through our vital connection with Christ we can be saved and hear the words, “Well done, my faithful servant.”

During the afternoon worship, they have individually shared their experiences inside the campus during the training to encourage batch 20 trainees to continue on their training despite of the trials that will come along the way. Most of them shared about sleeping in class. They knew that they had missed many precious lessons because of giving into the pleasure of sleeping. So they charged batch 20 not to sleep during classes. Some of the volunteers named them “the sleeping batch.” This batch taught each other many valuable lessons and gave each other inspiration. The name for this batch is connected to their illustration as they compare themselves to a rainbow. Each of them has a different color of personality that as these seven individuals join together in one group, they create one beautiful creation that reflects God’s character. 

At the end, these colorful young individuals expressed that they all want to serve the Lord through LIGHT ministry. So we are praying that after their vacation, they would really come back and be volunteers to Betterway foundation.
