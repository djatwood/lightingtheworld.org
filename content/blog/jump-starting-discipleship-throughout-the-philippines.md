Spring has finally reached eastern Tennessee. After an exceptionally long period of cold, damp,overcast weather, the sunshine and warmer temperatures have been cheerfully welcomed by many. Not surprisingly, we have seen a mighty resurgence of life in the formerly dormant flora. Vibrant colors that haven’t been seen in over a year are now bursting upon the previously dreary canvas of nature. It’s a spectacular sight. As our eyes sweep over the beauties of spring, we notice one plant springing forth more aggressively than the others. It’s the dandelion. On the hill right next to my office, there must be over 100 of these flower-like plants. One might wonder how these plants multiply so rapidly that in a matter of days an empty hill is completely covered. The answer is quite powerful and insightful. The life cycle of this plant is designed to promote its rapid proliferation.

Let’s take a look.

**Stage one:** Germination. The seed is planted and, due to the right conditions, the dandelion plant grows. **Stage two:** Flowering. The plant begins to develop its stalk and leaves and finally show its beautiful yellow flowers.**Stage three:**Reproduction. When the dandelion plant reaches maturity its flowers change into seeds with parachute-like structures attached to them so the wind can carry them to the location of the future dandelion plant.

Discipleship works the same way. **Stage one:** The word of God is faithfully preached and received by “good ground” hearers. **Stage two:**The word begins to develop, change, and mature the receiver into a shining reflection of God’s character. **Stage three:** The person begins to be a conduit of grace and love to their world, sharing the Word of God by precept and example. This person is a disciple-making disciple.

We have seen this trend repeated everywhere the gospel has been proclaimed and received. We particularly notice this trend in the country of the Philippines and with our graduates from the Better Way Foundation. Let’s take a look and see how the Lord is multiplying His workers throughout this country through their efforts. Medical Missionary Camp Meeting Last December the team held a Medical Missionary Camp Meeting with the theme entitled “Climb Up Higher”. In the past these type of meetings have generated great interest for medical missionary work culminating in an explosion of health evangelism. The messages were presented by the President of the North Philippine Union Conference, Pastor Manez, and Pastor Sullano. These service-oriented messages were so well received that a large percentage of the medical missionaries in attendance committed themselves to work in 19 mission fields thoughout the Philippines!

This is where the work has been exploding tremendously:

### Benguet in Northern Luzon

Missionaries have been able to share our heath message with many families through our food industry and freshly baked bread delivered right to people’s door.

### Palanan, Isabela

Three missionaries have been sent to this area to build interest with pre-work activities and to follow up with potential Bible study contacts.

### Malingay, Ilocos Norte

In spite of a strong Adventist presence in this province, the church has many members that have stopped attending. Two missionary ladies will be putting their efforts into evangelistic work for a year to regain the members that have fallen away and to draw others who have never heard  

of the love of Jesus.

### Santiago City

With the partnership of Cagayan Valley Sanitarium and Team Pamas, six medical missionaries have been carrying the health message into the community of this region through health expos, feeding programs, vacation Bible schools, treatments and Bible studies. God also provided the resources to build a community center of influence that consists of a bakery, a vegetarian restaurant and a treatment room.

### Adams, Ilocos Norte

Two ladies have decided to leave their professions and comfort to serve for a whole year. The new pioneering project is located in the mountains.

### Punta, Cavite

One of our graduates from the sixth batch is very active in children’s ministry. She has utilized her talents of story telling to appeal to children in the mission field. As a result of this, many children are now learning of the wondrous love of Jesus.

### Calatubog, Palawan

Two years ago, we started a program to reach out to the unreached people groups living in the mountains of this region. Health has again shown itself to be a powerful entering wedge. The people come to be treated for their common sicknesses and two of our missionaries serve as health counselors and educators.

We are encouraged to see the advancement of the work in various lines throughout the Philippines. Thousands upon thousands are being reached by the efforts of our medical missionary graduates. As we look forward to the future, we can’t help but be hopeful for greater days and a clearer perception of the fulfilled promise: “But as truly as I live, all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the Lord” (Numbers 14:21).

Please keep this project in your prayers.

Sincerely,

Shawn Craig
