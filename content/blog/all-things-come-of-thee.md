Dear friends and family, 










&#8220;The great day of the Lord is near, it is near, and hasteth greatly.&#8221;  

Zephaniah 1:14.










Rejoice with as we share the marvelous opportunities God has opened to us in sharing the gospel with the people of Cuba. We are excited to announce that 102 new medical missionary (MM) students are on fire for God. We know that He will use these individuals to bless the entire nation; lifting heavy burdens, bringing hope to the poor, relief to the suffering, and the light of the gospel to those who sit in darkness.  

Students and faculty spend the first hour of each day in united prayer worshiping the Savior, confessing sins, pleading for more of His character and claiming Bible promises. They pray that the glory of the Lord will be exalted in Cuba as people and nations flow into His house asking to be taught His ways (Micah 4). Students and leaders alike sense 2017 can be the year for this to take place.  

102 students send their utmost thanks to each of you for making this 9th medical missionary ‘LIGHT’ school in Cuba a reality in 2017. 

This week we saw the hand of God intervene in the provision of food. The benefits of whole grains are taught to students, but in Cuba, only refined white bread and white rice are available for meals. Nevertheless, we prayed, “Lord, help us find a source to buy whole grains”. Even though we were told this would be impossible, we felt impressed to go out searching. Claiming Proverbs 3:6 “In all thy ways acknowledge Him and He shall direct they paths”, we began walking through the maze of twisting narrow streets.

Seeing a man wearing the clothes of a baker while standing outside a large building, we confirmed this was a bakery and asked if we could speak with the chief officer. We were told to come back at 8am the next day. Returning prayerfully the next morning, we were directed to the back of the ancient edifice. It took several minutes of walking past rooms with antique mixers, ovens, dark hallways and storage rooms with large sacks of white flour. Finding our way to the chief’s office we were invited to enter and sit down adjacent to the desk of her boss. We told her of our interest in health and our desire to find whole grain bread to feed a large group of people studying health in our church. With a look of surprise, she said, “I just received some sacks of whole grain flour today. How much will you need”? We replied, “300 loaves per day until the end of the month”.

She picked up the phone summoning her head baker. Speaking briefly with her head baker, she turned to us and said, “We will supply all of your needs. Be here at 6am every day, starting tomorrow. Please stop in to let me know if you’re satisfied”. Excitedly, I thanked her and her coworkers by handing them each a Steps to Christ pamphlet. We stepped back out into the sunshine, and bowed our heads to thank God for the miracle of the loaves. Seeing tears in the eyes of my translator, I asked if she was OK, she said “did you hear what the chief said to the baker”? 










&#8220;This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die.&#8221;  

John 6:50.










She continued “God’s blessings are overwhelming, the boss told the head baker, ‘you must personally oversee the making of 300 whole grain loaves. You must use 100% whole wheat, and must not take any shortcuts. Be sure they are full size, weighted and baked perfectly. They must be your very best because they are for the Lord’”. Now it was my turn to be overwhelmed with renewed thanksgiving for God’s amazing provision. We wish you could have seen the excitement of the students this morning who, for the first time, enjoyed something they had only previously read about: whole grain bread. 

Church leaders rejoice that the first new house church for 2017 is being purchased in a large unreached coastal city off the tourist trail. Gratefully, the Lord provided an ideal location to serve the people being on a main avenue, 1 block from the coast and from the central city square. We praise the Lord that He has impressed the hearts of a mission minded church in Idaho to make plans to come and renovate the new house in order to prepare it for the medical missionaries to reach the people in the city.

The Lord has blessed us more than we could have ever imagined here in Cuba. Our greatest joy is to witness the changed lives and inexpressible joy that Jesus brings. The medical missionary practical gospel of Isaiah 58 opens doors to share the ultimate redeeming gospel of Christ’s life, death &#038; resurrection. Void of sophisticated programming or eloquence, the work goes forward with a simplicity that confounds those with greater wisdom. If there was only one word to describe the work of Jesus, it might be to ‘care’. God cared enough to send His only begotten Son to mingle, sympathize, minister, win confidence and to give His life for the salvation of the world. Can any of us care like Jesus? Thank God for His new covenant promise to write His law in our hearts and to teach us His ways. We are grateful for your support and prayers for these students as they seek the heart of Christ. Many of you have outdone yourselves, giving above your means to support the medical missionary work to win Cuba for Christ. Without adequate words, we can only say thank you with all of our hearts. Rejoice with us for the great things God is accomplishing through your sacrificial gifts. Very soon the work will be finished and Jesus will come. May the Lord keep us faithful until the day we look up and say “Lo, this is our God; we have waited for Him, and He will save us”.
