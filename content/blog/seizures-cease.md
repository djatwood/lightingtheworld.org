One of the local staff here on campus has a sister that has been having  

&#8220;fits&#8221; or seizure of various kinds.  She has been having them for several  

years.  They have been to the extent that she has required constant  

supervision and heavy medication.  With the success of God&#8217;s work in the  

health lines at the Wellness Center, we were asked if this sister could come  

for help.

Kori invited her in to live in the Wellness Center and began  

educating her in the lines of God&#8217;s way if health.  With much prayer,  

guidance from God and persistence, after just a very short time, the  

seizures ended.  Daily Kori noticed that it seemed that her mind was  

stronger and coming back.  She left a different person that when she came.  

She was now very helpful and interested in many things, where as before she  

was in her own little world.  She went home feeling well and had stopped her  

medications.

Upon frequent request to the family for updates, we have  

learned that she for the first time since becoming sick was able to go to  

camp meeting ALL BY HERSELF!  She no longer requires constant supervision  

and is seeking spiritual food!  We are so excited for what God has done for  

this young lady.  To God be all the glory as He still heals as we seek Him  

and cooperate with Him.  I am so thankful for the work that God is doing  

through Kori and the Wellness Center.  We are still seeking for support for  

this branch of the work.  We are also seeking to grown and make things that  

will allow this work to be self-supportive in the long run.
