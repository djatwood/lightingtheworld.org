*This experience is told through the perspective of Shanniel Fisher, the Inter-America Divisional Director.











For many years, we have received invitations to do short seminars in Jamaica. In fact, last year we had a one week health seminar in four conferences of the Jamaican Union. I was very excited when they accepted to do the first ever one month “Essentials of Health Training Program”! The seminar was held at the Central  Jamaican Conference throughout the month of April, with over 90 persons attending daily. At the end of the month, 83 enthusiastic missionaries graduated. The group consisted of pastors, lay members, health professionals, administrative secretaries of the conference and some pastor’s wives.

What’s more interesting about the work in Jamaica, is that I met with a group of missionaries there at the end of 2017. They have been excited in starting a six-month training school there! They decided that the time has come to move forward. God provided a beautiful piece of property with buildings and sufficient land for agriculture, and with the providences and leading of God, preparations are in place to start this school on the island.

It is indeed exciting to see what God is doing in Jamaica! Now, some of the graduates from the one month training, are planning to take part in the above mentioned six-month course. I believe God is working marvelously in this field, and Jamaica will be a suitable hub in the Caribbean, for medical missionary training.
