&#8220;Christ&#8217;s method alone will give true success in reaching the people. The Saviour mingled with men as one who desired their good. He showed His sympathy for them, ministered to their needs, and won their confidence. Then He bade them, “Follow Me.”&#8221;  

MH 143.3.










Joy was strongly against Jesus but all of her family, expect her and her brother, were Christian. She gave her parents a lot of problems because she was not Christian. She hated her family and she never obeyed her parents. She always criticized her father and mother&#8217;s religion. One day I got a chance to spend time with her. I tried to preach to her about Jesus but I was not able to succeed because she was always speaking critically about Him. Nonetheless, I continued to try to share with her the reality of Jesus. However, there was no way because she didn’t like to listen to me. Therefore, I started to just listen to her. That made her happy.

The second time I visited her house and tried to talk with her about Jesus but the same thing happened. She just tried to make me understand her own ways. So, the second day also I only listened to her and I came back home. The same thing was repeated several days, but after several visits she began to talk less and listen more. Then it became just the opposite. I started to talk more and she was listening more. I started to share with her about Jesus more deeply day by day. I started to regularly visit her house and preach to her and also her family, even though they were already Christian, but that time my main focus was her, because she wasn’t a Christian. Then I started giving her daily Bible studies and by the grace of God, she started to listen carefully, so I knew the Holy Spirit was working in her mind. Finally, by the grace of God, I was able to convince her after 9 months to accept Christ. She started to come regularly to Church over several months and last month she got baptized in the name of Christ. Now I am still praying for her brother because he is not yet coming to church. So, please pray for him.
