One of our local academies (from grades 1st – 8th grade) strives to prepare their students to love and serve Christ. Lives are being changed for the better. The older students have been quite a blessing to their community. They have learned how to give health and temperance talks, presenting them in a way that is uplifting to the soul.  The high school students are maturing growing up to be helpful and loving individuals for God’s work. It has been a blessing seeing them become skilled in their training. They have been able to practically apply what they’ve learned. We praise God for all He has done for us!

Adam, one of our students, has been raised in our school since he was a small boy. His father left his pregnant mother with two little boys. Adam was the youngest. The mother has no way to pay for rent, so the landlord put her and her sons on the street. The went to the train station to live and beg for food. After some time, I had taken some students to catch a train so that we could visit a village that we had helped establish. While on the train platform, our students got together and started to sing. I noticed the mother with the two boys standing in the front of the crowd that gathered to listen. The train came and we pushed into the very crowded car and left. When we got off the train, we got on a bus that would take us to our destination. The same mother that was with her boys had gotten on the same bus we were on. So, I asked her, “Do you live in the next village”? She answered, “No…I have no money to feed my boys, and I see that your children are happy. Please take my children and raise them”.

I gave her some money for food and travel for the weekend and told her to come by our school on Monday so that she could bring her sons. She was there early Monday morning.  She begged us to take her sons. I could tell she desperately needed help and I sympathized with her pain. We took the boys and asked if she wanted to work for us. She happily accepted! She stayed working for us until she had her baby boy, Elijah. Afterwards, she got a job in the city and moved, to be closer to her workplace. We have raised all three of her boys.  Their mother has come to the school often. She brings presents when she can and shows them so much love. Elijah is still in our school and Adam is on the work crew. I am amazed at what a hardworking and very practical minded boy he is, so humble and always thinking ahead. Jesus is in his heart and I am blessed to have him as my boy. He is doing well in his classes, like many of the other boys and girls at our school. I praise the Lord for His continuous blessings.
