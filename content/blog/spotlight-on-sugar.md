Sugar: how sweet it is &#8230; or is it? We were designed to enjoy the taste of sweet foods. Packaged in its naturally-occurring form as found in fruits, and to a lesser degree in grains, nuts, and vegetables, sugar can afford both enjoyment and nutrition to our diet. But during the last century and a half, the introduction and ever-increasing use of refined (or free) sugar has changed the scene to one with some very bitter side effects. Rich, highly-sweetened foods are more readily available than ever before. Arrays of candy, cookies, donuts, ice cream, and other sugar-laden “treats” seem to greet us on every hand. The food industry also adds refined sweeteners to many commonly-used and often unsuspected items, from dried fruit and nut butters to canned vegetables and supplements. Is it any wonder that the average American’s sweet tooth has intensified? Nature’s whole foods often no longer taste sweet enough. The price tag for this trend is high. Let’s consider some of the negative health effects caused by using added sugars too generously.  




### What follows the taste?




**
Obesity:
** A sweet moment on the lips adds padding to the hips! Sugar intake contributes to this huge current health concern in the USA. Columbia University researcher, Claire Wang, Ph.D., stated, in a special obesity edition of The Lancet,that about 1 in 3 adults in the U.S. today are obese, and if little is done to address this epidemic, that figure will rise to half of American adults by 2030! Since obesity leads to a number of chronic diseases, its rise will likely bring higher rates of metabolic syndrome, diabetes, heart disease, arthritis, and some cancers, among other adverse physiological conditions.How do free forms of sugar contribute to excess weight? First, they are concentrated foods. For example, when sugar is produced from sugar beets or sugar cane, nearly all of the fiber, minerals, and other nutrients are removed during the refining process. It takes approximately 16 pounds of beets or 10 pounds of sugar cane to produce 1 pound of pure sugar (or sucrose). 

Imagine eating four pounds of sugar beets or about three pounds of sugar cane in one sitting—fiber and all. It might involve some determination and plenty of chewing! But slurping down a mere 21 ounce milkshake would give you about the same amount of sugar, with far less bulk or fiber than the beets or cane. It’s not hard to see how the calories can add up quickly when eating sugary, concentrated foods.Especially is this the case with sweetened beverages, since drinking calories tends to make us feel less “full” than if we were to eat the same amount in solid form. Moreover, since free sugar is a nutritionally bankrupt food, it can increase the risk of nutritional imbalance. This can manifest itself in a sense of “hunger.” A person can eat a lot of donuts or chocolates and still not feel “satisfied.” The body may be hungry for the needed nutrients that sugar-laden, highly-refined foods are missing, with the result that we continue to eat. Add to this sugar’s addictive qualities, and it is not hard to see how these white, sparkling crystals can readily add on the pounds.

**
Malnutrition:
** Although the generous use of sugar encourages weight gain, it can also indirectly contribute to malnutrition. The more sugary foods a person eats, the less appetite and room tends to be left in the diet for more healthful foods. Moreover, although refined sugar is largely depleted of its original vitamins, minerals, and phytochemicals, it requires these nutrients for its metabolism. For example, about 98 percent of the chromium present in sugar cane is lost during the refining process. This mineral, along with the B vitamins and other nutrients, is needed for the proper digestion and management of sugar.2 Since sugar does not supply the needed elements, the body needs to draw on its reserves of these nutrients. Over time, if a person continues to eat too much sugar, the demand will exceed the supply, and mineral and vitamin deficiencies can result.

**
Depression:
** B vitamins are critically essential for maintaining a positive mood. Because a high sugar intake can deplete these vitamins, it is not surprising that excess sugar in the diet can lead to depression. Strong evidence supports this association.

**
Risky fats:
** Not only does the generous use of free sugar contribute to extra pounds, but it also stimulates the production of a potentially harmful form of fat—triglycerides. These molecules, generally formed in the liver when more food is eaten than needed by the body, can be deposited around the waist (visceral fat), which is a particularly dangerous type of fat. It can also be deposited in the blood vessels or elsewhere in the body. Researchers found that rats fed a sucrose-rich diet developed high triglycerides, which then induced visceral fat, and ultimately resulted in insulin resistance. Tooth trouble: Sugar also increases tooth decay. Damaged teeth cannot repair themselves well. Considering the cost of dental work, that sweet tooth can become quite pricey!

**
Weakened immunity:
** Another well-known effect of generous sugar intake is that of compromised immune function. More people get sick during the holiday season. Why? The body’s bacteria-fighting white blood cells become increasingly sluggish and impotent in proportion to the amount of sugar eaten. More serious still, high sugar intake is associated with a number of common cancers. Blood-sugar trouble: Because simple sugars are so readily absorbed into the bloodstream, they can cause unhealthful glucose spikes and subsequent drops in susceptible persons, such as those with diabetes or hypoglycemia. This hypoglycemic cycle, repeated, can contribute to metabolic syndrome, a condition characterized by a malfunction of blood sugar control, hypertension, high cholesterol levels, and obesity. That same candy bar that gives you fast energy, will also tend to quickly nosedive your blood-glucose level, leaving you feeling lower than you did before eating the sugar-rich pick-me-up. Incidentally, once the blood sugar level has dropped lower than normal, it can require several hours for your frontal lobe to fully recover. So sugary foods are not necessarily the best choice for enhanced critical thinking. Indeed, studies suggest a possible correlation between sugar intake and decreased cognitive and intellectual function, particularly in children.

**
Inflammation:
** Sugar promotes inflammation in the body. When eaten in large quantities, it is actually more harmful than meat, which is a major cause of inflammation. Researchers found that excess table sugar added to the diet of mice significantly reduced the beneficial anti-inflammatory properties of omega-3 fats. This points out that too much refined sugar in the diet, even if accompanied by healthful foods, can be harmful.

**
Increased PMS:
** In a study done on young women, a high sugar diet, including sweet beverages, exacerbated their premenstrual discomforts.10 Although refined foods may be just what many women crave during their monthly cycle, such foods appear to be less than “comforting!”

**
Tummy woes:
** Sugary foods are bad news for the stomach, commonly causing fermentation, indigestion,brain fog, and irritability. The combination of sugar, milk, and eggs as main ingredients, such as found in many custards, puddings, and ice cream, is especially harmful.

**
Addictive properties:
** Sugar’s sizeable list of bitter effects is compounded by its tendency to be addictive. Many people find that the more they eat it, the more they crave it. Why is this? Scientific studies reveal actual neurochemical similarities between overeating and drug addiction. Binge eating of sugar releases opioids and dopamine in the limbic system, effects associated with addiction. Ellen White, a progressive health authority of her time, wrote over a century ago that “Sugar clogs the system. It hinders the working of the living machine. Anything that hinders the active motion of the living machinery affects the brain very directly.”

So, what can we do to hop off the sugar-go-round?




**
1) Read labels.
** Many packaged foods include added sugars. Try to choose those with little or no added sugar. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the total amount of sugar in our diet (the sugar naturally present in food as well as that added to food) should not represent more than 10 percent of the total calorie intake. For a 2,000 calorie per day diet, this would mean 200 calories originating from sugars, an equivalent of 50 g per day.  

**
2) Avoid overeating and caffeine use.
** Both tend to encourage the desire for sweet foods. Drink unsweetened beverages, such as pure water.

**
3) Emphasize whole foods.
** A healthful diet decreases the craving for refined sweets. Try replacing highly refined sugars with moderate amounts of more nutritious ones. Enjoy naturally sweet produce, like fruits, sweet potatoes, winter squash, and others. These foods, packaged with their native nutrients and beneficial fibers, promote better health and longer-term satisfaction.

**
4) Reeducate your taste buds.
**The American Heart Association Many a weaned sugar lover can testify that after some time, the natural sweetness found in whole foods is more perceptible, enjoyable, and even preferred to the sugared fare previously desired. Our taste buds are replaced about every 3 to 10 days, so don’t despair. You are not hopelessly stuck with that sweet tooth!

**
5) Follow a healthful lifestyle.
** Daily exercise, positive stress management, regular adequate rest, and a balanced diet will combine to decrease the drive for sugary foods.

**
6) Plan for success.
** Avoid temptation. Don’t keep unhealthful treats around or unnecessarily expose your senses to foods that might weaken your resolve. When you see donuts, think, “do-nots!”

Moderation is something better! Remember, reducing excess sugar does not mean reducing true enjoyment! The Good Book says that honey is good, but not too much!  

As the wise saying goes, health is not an accident, but an achievement. Choice by choice, we can be on the winning side, and trade in sugar’s bite for nature’s sweeter delights. Now that’s rewarding!
