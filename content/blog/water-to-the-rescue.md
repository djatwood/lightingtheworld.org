Drink more water, wash hands often, keep frequently touched surfaces clean… Over the course of the last few weeks, these instructions have been said, posted and written everywhere. COVID-19 has taken the world by storm and everyone is advised to do their part to prevent it from spreading. Good hygiene is essential, and water is an important part of cleaning internally and externally. But that’s not the only way to use water during this time. Water can also be used to strengthen the immune system and activate blood flow to boost the body in order to fight against not only the coronavirus but also against most other flus and sicknesses.

It’s called a contrast bath/shower. The official definition is: “the immersion of a body part alternately in hot and cold water.”* ** Doing this dilates (hot) and constricts (cold) the bloods vessels, concentrating and increasing blood flow to the area where the contrast is being performed. It also enhances oxygen flow to the area and helps reduce swelling, joint pain, and prevents infection or the spread of infection.*** But how does that help with the flu or coronavirus? Well, the key is a contrast shower. See, a shower hits the entire body, so when you do the contrasts, you’re increasing the blood flow to your whole body. While increasing your body’s blood circulation, you are also boosting the number of white blood cells circulating in the body and pumping your immune system into action.****

So, how exactly is a contrast shower done? Start with hot water for three minuets, then switch to cold for 30 seconds. Do at least 3 changes, each time increasing the temperature of the hot and decreasing the temperature of the cold. Make sure to finish with cold. Dry off briskly and rest for a bit afterwards for best results. This treatment is recommended to be once a day on a normal basis, but if you start feeling symptoms of a cold or flu, take a contrast shower at least twice a day and increase the changes to four or five.

Now, remember, contrast showers do not cure a cold, the flu, or COVID-19. It only helps boost your immune system, increase blood circulation and boost white blood cell movement and development. Even then, this treatment alone will not completely protect you from the possibility of getting sick. We should practice this along with proper rest, proper diet, exercise and proper hygiene to reap its full benefits. Yet above all, remember to trust in the Master Physician. Hard times may come, but God is the one who will ultimately protect us when we put our trust in Him.

“Be strong and of a good courage, fear not, nor be afraid of them: for the LORD thy God, He [it is] that doth go with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.” -Deuteronomy 31:6
