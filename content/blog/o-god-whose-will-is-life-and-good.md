This weekend, our students, together with their teachers, helped with a large Health Expo in Europe. The students were quite excited before such an important event and they had a lot of emotions, including fear. Yet, at the same time, they shared a great desire to be a part of this event and help people to learn more about how to maintain and strengthen their health. The Health Expo was scheduled for a Sunday. It was a windy and sunny day. We were blessed as several people came. They wanted to hear useful information and learn different measurements &#8211; weight, height, fat percentage, blood pressure, biological age, etc. Everyone also received a relaxing chair massage, ministering to the physical side as well as the mental education aspect. About 3,000 books were distributed. About 200 people had time to go through all the measurements and many people could also consult with the doctor. During the Health Expo, we prayed with many visitors and several of them asked us to continue praying for them. Those who realized the value of the information they received during our program were interested to participate in similar events in the future.










&#8220;Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.&#8221;  

James 5:16.










Having participated in the health program, the students had positive impressions, because this event did not happen without a visible manifestation of the power of God. According to the weather forecast, it was supposed to rain all day long. However, as soon as the participants arrived at the venue, the rain stopped, the clouds went away and the sun appeared. The weather was clear and sunny until the health Expo was finished, after which it began to rain again. The strong prayer of the righteous man can do much (James 5:16). Praise the Lord for Him being part of our lives! Our students were very happy that they could help so many people and be useful in serving their brothers and sisters in Christ.
