*This is told in the perspective of a LIGHT worker in India.










God opened the doors for us to speak in a Pentecostal church. As a result, many of those individuals who were in attendance are willing to come to our LIGHT training program in July. They eagerly asked us to teach about health from the Bible.

Instead of having foreigners train them, we felt that it would be more effective if people from their nation trained them on health principles. We pray that these trainings will be beneficial to all of our prospective students.

In addition to this wonderful report, we are pleased to announce that there was a LIGHT training program for the Youth that recently took place! A committed team whole-heartedly worked with these young people and taught them basic Bible doctrines, health principles, prophecies and more. Many young people have been benefitted and blessed by this meeting.

There were 82 young people in attendance. We had a very good response from everyone. We pray that those who have been trained will share their knowledge with others.
