Thanks and glory be to God for successfully opening Cameroon with the right arm of the 3rd Angel&#8217;s message &#8211; Medical missionary work.  

The recently concluded training in Yaounde in collaboration with the Division was a great success. It brought a revival and set the stage for a brighter future for the work here.  

At the graduation, both directors of the two key departments for the lay work at the Division level (the health and personal ministries departments) were present and were hugely impressed by what they saw. The division&#8217;s personal ministries department director who is also Cameroonian is proposing that we return to cameroon next January 2017 to training 1000 people with the help of his department to prepare members for Total Member Involvement, the Rwanda type initiative for 2017. Liberia is already slated for January we hope to sort out the dates with Cameroon.

There is another call from the English town of Kumba still in Cameroon next year.  

In conclusion, our training in Yaounde brought us 114 graduates and 32 people expressed their interest to further advance their knowledge in the medical-missionary field by taking a six months online course.

Thank to:
