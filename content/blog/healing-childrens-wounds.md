We just had a wonderful LIGHT course graduation of 27 young men and women who are ready to serve. Sixteen of these graduates would like to deepen their knowledge by attending our Bible Seminary Program, which is starting September 16.

Korsen Kisku a graduate of our seminary is in charge of our evangelism programs in Hazaribah, Bokaro and Chachkopi. Four of our other seminary graduates are working in Hazaribagh and Bokaro. Every day Korsen takes two students from our school here in Chachkopi into villages surrounding Spring of Joy. They visit door to door and take care of people&#8217;s needs. They cycle about 30-35 Km up and down and serve the people.

Following we have some pictures and short stories from their work.

Poonam is one of our church member in Bokaro. Her husband is a carpenter. Our Bible worker are visiting her regularly. She offered one of her rooms to worship every Sabbath. She encourages others to come to church. When our team, along with our doctor, were in Bokaro, they visited her. She says that she really wants to see a Seventh day Adventist church in Bokaro. Let&#8217;s pray that God works a miracle in Bokaro.

These two pictures are from the village of Tirangtoli near Springs of Joy. Two of our seminary students (Dipti Koiri and Nirmal soren) did outreach in this village for a few days. According to both of them, almost all the children had some kind of wounds somewhere on their bodies. Our students cleaned all of their wounds and put bandages and some medicine or charcoal on them. After, a few days they were healed. Now when our students go to this village all of these children come and try to be very close to them.
