A relatively new adventist, Joan* decided to come to our one month course at Los Orígenes. She had only been baptized a year before coming to the course, therefore helping her to understand many new things from the health and Bible classes during the month. Even though she didn&#8217;t necessarily enjoy the treatments when it was her turn to be the recipient, she did have to confess that she felt the benefits afterward. This all helped her to become a more firm believer in natural remedies.

At the end of the course, Joan* expressed her desire to use her new knowledge in whatever way God called her to. She was ready and willing to share her testimony of how natural remedies had improved her own health, and helping others believe that it could help their health as well. Even during just one month, she was able to experience the benefits and improve her health. So if one month could do so much, could it be that a six month course would benefit her more? This is the question God will have to answer in his own time.
