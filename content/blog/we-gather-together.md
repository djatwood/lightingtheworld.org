“True education is missionary training. Every son and daughter of God is called to be a missionary; we are called to the service of God and our fellow men; and to fit us for this service should be the object of our education”  

Our team flew to Tunisia for a public health program. We were joined by a group of seven brothers and sisters.  

The Adventist Church in Tunisia has very few church members, half of whom are from other countries. With 11 million inhabitants, the country is about four times the size of Switzerland. We decided to encourage the local church to provide resources and to show perspectives on how to reach their fellow citizens.  

With the support of more than 15 young local ADRA volunteers (Muslims and some Adventists), we conducted health expos in several public places. The people were queuing and eagerly waiting to check their health. A local radio reporter appeared several times to interview us during the expo. Soon, our group was known everywhere. When we went shopping with our green T-shirts, the salespeople in the store were already greeting us from afar. Some visitors came back several times to thank for the free service. Repeatedly, guests offered to help us at the next expo. 1000 visitors came to the event. 600 of them gave us their contact information.  

Tunisia is only a little more than two hours away (by plane) from Switzerland. The health message can be used to soften the hearts of the people to respond to God’s call. In autumn, the small community wants to organize another health expo event. The harvest truly is great, but the laborers are few. Please pray for the work that is being done in this country. God will make a way for everything to go according to His plan.
