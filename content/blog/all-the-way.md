One of our previous graduates, Mara, had lost her mother during the earthquake in Nepal. Soon after that, she joined our Women&#8217;s Ministries Course. We gave her the opportunity to take the Advanced Tailoring course. She went back to her village and started a tailoring shop. I went to attend a wedding of one of our previous students near the village that Mara resided in. We had an opportunity to visit one of the churches that were started by some of our graduates. We had helped them especially in the beginning to get the church started. It has been growing ever since.

This time, when we went there, it was a blessing to see the church with many people in it. I was so happy to see Mara’s progress. She is doing well in her tailoring shop. She is now able to support herself and is busy with her sewing while teaching others as well. She is faithful in church and capable of supporting herself. I felt this was a real success. I praise the Lord and thank Him for His help.
