*This is told in the perspective of Rodney Bowes, LIGHT&#8217;s North Asia Divisional Director.









In Acts 2, we read that one of the amazing things of the outpouring of God’s Spirit on the day of Pentecost was that everyone heard the gospel message in their own language. At LIGHT, we believe in the importance of translating our material into as many languages as possible.  Our goal is to educate, inspire, and equip people around the world to share the love of Jesus Christ in their own language. We wish it was a simple process that could be done in a matter of days or weeks, but it is not that easy.  Parts of the curriculum are quite easy to translate, while others are much more complex and labor intensive.  The Bible verses are (usually) just a cut and paste process. The challenge comes with the writings of Ellen White and the scientific terms that are associated with several of our classes.  In many of our target languages, there is little Spirit of Prophecy translated more than the Conflict of The Ages series.  To ensure accuracy of these gems of truth, we have asked several people with a good understanding of her writings to review the text and translate it to the best of their ability. We then have two or more proofreaders go over the translation to verify the quality of the work.

Another challenge we face, is with the complex scientific words and concepts that we convey in our classes like Nutrition, Principles of Health, and Common Diseases. Not just anyone can do this type of translation. So, once again we find people who understand these terms and are able to articulate them in their language. After the initial draft is completed, we find proofreaders to ensure the translation is accurate and free of grammatical errors. Lastly, there may be challenges dealing with formatting. It may sound easy but this step is quite complex with different characters, pagination, positioning of the graphics, etc.  We earnestly solicit your prayers as we attempt to get our material into as many languages as possible.  In North Asia, we have completed the translation of our courses in Korean. We are still working on the course translation in the following languages: Chinese, Japanese, and Mongolian.
