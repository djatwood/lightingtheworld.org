Wildwood’s first team that arrived in India commenced their work on January 9, 2017. 40 Bible workers were scheduled to be trained from the East Central Indian Union. Gospel Outreach, a ministry that strives to finish the work within the 10/40 window, has been supporting these bible workers while they learn about Christ’s method of reaching fallen humanity.

In order to minister to the needs of the Indian people, this team focused on equipping their bible workers with health evangelism principles. Some of the topics include the eight laws of health, hydrotherapy, massage, disease prevention and much more!

The training took place in a state that is known for their spicy cuisine. Interestingly enough, a LIGHT teacher who attended the trip to India presented a talk that pertained to the negative impacts of heavily spiced foods on the human body. Many of the bible workers felt a conviction to change their eating habits and decided to make positive lifestyle changes for their futures.  

Every Sabbath the team was divided into 4 groups, and ministered to different churches in the area.

Every afternoon, the bible workers went to do outreach by conducting health surveys in the community. Towards the end of the Light Training Program, the LIGHT Team conducted a Health Expo, where a total of 160 individuals received information to improve their health.

This team would like to praise God for His providential leading during their stay. Although sickness had stricken some of their members, it is important to remember that we serve an almighty, powerful and loving Lord. By His grace, the team completed the training successfully.

Currently, the team is in another state training several pastors and lay members. As they seek the Lord for His leading, continual prayer and support will be needed to spread the health message to the ends of the Earth. Thankfully, these pastors and lay members are eager to share their newly found knowledge of medical missionary work in their local churches.
