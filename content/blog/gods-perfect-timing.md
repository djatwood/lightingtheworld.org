As told by Carin Lynch, LIGHT North America Director










While preparing to begin a LIGHT Course at the La Vida Mission in New Mexico, we attended a Navajo Indian Camp Meeting in Arizona. During the program, we were given some time to share with the congregation about LIGHT and the upcoming LIGHT School.  This is where we met Joel, a 30-year-old Native American Navajo.

Joel was a carnival worker, living a rough life of drugs and alcohol while traveling from town to town across the western United States. By God’s grace, he was visiting home and stumbled upon the camp meeting. After the presentation, he quickly approached us and stated he wanted to change his life and wanted to attend the LIGHT course. The Pastor of the Chinle SDA Church offered to pay for Joel’s room, board and registration. Within 5 minutes, he was traveling with us on a 4-hour van ride back to La Vida Mission.

Joel is not a Seventh-day Adventist. As a child, being passed around from foster home to foster home across 5 states, he encountered a loving Seventh-day Adventist family who cared for him and his sister for about a year and a half.  Joel stated that they were the only family that truly showed them love. This is where he was introduced to the Adventist message. Although they are in Hawaii now, he has remained in contact with the family for the last 20 years.

A smoker and alcoholic, Joel came to the LIGHT School with an open heart and an open mind. He was the most attentive of the class, desiring to know God’s word and his message of health and hope. As the classes commenced, Joel responded to the Lord’s leading in his life. Within a week, a true transformation happened in Joel’s life &#8211; he wanted “life more abundant!”

Upon graduation of the LIGHT course and through a series of miracles, Joel was on a 58-hour bus ride to Butler Creek Health Center in Iron City, Tennessee to attend a 30 day “Victorious Living Program”.  The good news… the story doesn’t end there. His successful participation at Butler Creek and the sincere desire to be a new creature in Christ has inspired Joel to attend a one-year work-scholarship/medical missionary school right at Butler Creek.

Joel doesn’t know where God is leading him to be after his program, however, he hopes to one day minister to his own people on the reservation and share God’s love through health evangelism.

It is truly amazing how God’s timing is perfect.  First, the impromptu decision to go that morning to the camp meeting, Secondly, only by God’s grace did Joel walk over to attend the program at the church that day. Third, the Holy Spirit spoke to his heart and now his life has been changed for the Kingdom.
