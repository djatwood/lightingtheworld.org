My medical missionary experience started when my friend invited me to attend a health evangelism program called “Fundación Orion”. I accepted the call to go train to be a missionary. I took a LIGHT course for 9 months. We learned many valuable tools as it pertains to health and spreading the gospel. I truly learned a lot, during my time there. During that year, I was able to have a more in-depth knowledge of God, in the area of evangelism. After my wonderful learning experience at this particular institution, I was blessed with the opportunity to work as a volunteer missionary at another center located in Chile, called Los Aromos Wellness Center, which affiliated with LIGHT. The first year I worked there, I assisted with the various activities taking place at the center, such as training courses for missionaries, church weekend seminars, as well as the various programs available for the lifestyle center guests.

After completing my one year as a volunteer at Los Aromos, they invited me to stay and assist for one more year. This time, I served as chaplain of this institution. I prayed to God, to ask for His guidance and I stayed for another year. This was an opportunity to support and assist with the spiritual health of the guests and the institution as a whole. Shortly after, we organized outreach activities, around the neighborhood, in order to have possible contacts, so that people may know the Lord through the ministry of health. This outreach program is still active today. During the time I was able to work at Los Aromos, many interesting things happened in my life. These things have greatly impacted my thoughts, my decisions, and my future.

One time, a guest who did not know the Lord, came to do some work at this institution for just one day and asked me what I was doing at this place. I told him that I was serving the Lord, as a volunteer missionary. He asked if I was being paid and I told him that I did not receive money for my labor, because it was a volunteer service. I explained to him, that I was helping by faith and the Lord supplies all of my needs. This was an interesting conversation, because the gentleman was telling me that I shouldn’t do that at all. He also stated that I will be needing money to do things. I told him that the Lord can provide for all of my needs. He asked if I was attending school and I said that I haven’t had the opportunity to do so yet. I told him that if the Lord wanted me to have an opportunity to study or do something else, I know that He will show it me. This conversation was very interesting, because the gentleman was shocked and confused. He couldn’t understand what I was doing there. I think it may not be easy for some people to understand it, because serving the Lord is one of the most important decisions one may do. It is a way of living. It is a lifestyle, where we can see how the Lord sustains us every day. The Lord gives us the opportunity to testify about the things He does in our lives daily. This allows us to tell others about Him.

During this other opportunity, I was able to share a devotional thought with the guests at the lifestyle center. When I ended, a guest asked if I had finished my studies. I said I hadn’t finished. I explained the reasons why and she said that she was the director of schools and knew many people in the ministry of education. She informed me that she would do everything she could, to help me succeed in my studies. I said, “If it is the Lord’s will, the doors will open”. The lady left. Shortly after this, she came back for a second health program.  She told me that she spoke with a group of ministry education leaders and that I had to go to an interview, to begin the process. With much prayer, I went to the interview. I prayed a lot. A lot happened. I prayed for His will and He opened the doors. After a few months, I finished my next level of my pending studies. Then, the director said she wanted me to study theology and she’ll pay for all of my studies. This had a profound impact on me. For a while, I had a strong desire to serve the Lord. He had placed a burden upon my heart to become a pastor. The Lord heard my prayers and He answered. It has been an amazing experience seeing how the Lord has blessed everything, from my life in Bolivia, through institutions such as “Fundación Orion” and “Los Aromos” which opened the doors for me to get to meet other people from other places that give us knowledge and tools to be able to take this message and finish the work. I’m very thankful to God, because these institutions helped me to focus the path of my life. My spiritual life was dwindling before I came to these institutions. However, it is almost as if the Lord was saying, “This is the way, You have to go this way”.

It was difficult at the beginning, but as the Lord was leading, I surrendered my will to God and He opened the doors. His will came through for every decision. I am very happy to serve the Lord this way. The way He led everything has had a deep impact in my life. I’m very thankful to the Lord and happy that He continues to lead everything. I am currently in the selection process at the university, to be able to study theology. I know God will lead everything, according to His divine will.
