I remember the first time I saw Polly, sitting in the dining room in our training center. Alone, waiting for her mother who was in an interview with the director of ACCESS. Her beautiful and big eyes were expressing hope, but at the same time fear. Our center was their only exit for her to come back closer to God and be educated to serve Him.  

She is just 20 years old and has already experienced the struggles that addictions to drugs bring.  

Born in Shumen, Bulgaria, in a seventh day adventist family, Polly grew up attending the local church with her father, mother and twin-brother. Every Sabbath she enjoyed the Children’s Sabbath School, but at the age of 12 she somehow felt no more attracted for the church program.  

At that time, she was feeling as an outsider and very lonely in her family, so she began meeting new friends and attend parties, where she started to smoke and use drugs. She liked so much the new experience because she felt more confident going deeper and deeper into it.

Sadly, after some time, all her friends abandoned her and the relationship with her parents got very bad. The addictions made Polly hit the bottom. Tired of that life and the pain she caused to her family, she came to her mother for help, who then told her about the ACCESS Training Center in Bulgaria, where she had received an Intensive Medical Missionary Course in May 2019. Polly knew she herself was so far from God, but she grasped the possibility for receiving the help she needed so much. Happy to be accepted into the school, the hope came back in her life.  

The first week she was looking for every excuse to return home. Classes in the morning, detox treatment in the afternoon, new diet and lifestyle &#8211; it was just too much for her! Moreover, her English was not good enough to understand what was taught and she was feeling lost.  

The second week she got help – one of the missionaries translated into her mother language, and in this way she got a better understanding for some of the topics. It was hard for her to keep concentrated, but the dynamics of the program helped to catch her interest and attention. The missionary trips and the support of the students and the staff were a major key to success in this process.  

For just two and a half months, Polly has already noticed the changes which the Holy Spirit has performed in her life through the training. She feels more content with the new diet and knowledge she receives.  

There is still a long way to walk, but she has the hope that God will help her to overcome every temptation and tendency to satisfy the worldly cravings. Her desire now is to serve God as a missionary for the rest of her life and never to come back to her previous life.
