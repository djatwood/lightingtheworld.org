 A story from Instituto Vida Sana Redénsión










Everything started 5 years ago thanks to Isaiah 58:1-14. We spent days praying for the Holy Spirit’s guidance and studying the chapter in great detail. As a result, we decided to start a new ministry called the Isaiah 58 Ministry; free, benefit cafeterias for the vulnerable population (the homeless, elderly, immigrants, single moms, and traveling vendors). Today, this ministry forms part of the experience of everyone that comes through our Institute.

Due to the outbreak of COVID-19, our free cafeteria had to close down because of new hygiene laws the government put in place to keep everyone safer. We prayed to our Heavenly Father and asked: “What do we now?.” Not much time passed when some people who were familiar with the work talked about in Isaiah 58 came looking for us. God answered our prayers. They offered to provide the necessary materials if we would be in charge of cooking the food.  

We started by cooking 100 lunches on Sunday, March 29, 2020. We continued with 200 lunches, and the next Friday and Sunday, we prepared 1000 lunches both days. We not only prepared food for the less fortunate, but now we were also providing lunches for those affected financially by COVID-19. To sum up our work, the government of Fusagasugá is asking us to prepare and serve 70 lunches per day for the elderly for the next 60 days.

We give God the honor and glory because starting April 14, 2020, we will be preparing 200 lunches daily, and 1000 lunches on Sundays. We praise God because while we thought we were going to give food to only 100 people, He provided the means to serve 1000 people with not only physical food but also spiritual food through added literature.

Today we have seen the message in Isaiah 55:8-9 fulfilled. The thoughts and ways of our good Lord are higher than what we can imagine. We have also seen fulfilled the mission given to in many Bible texts—especially Isaiah 58. We are very excited t continue with this work during this crisis and others that might come after.
