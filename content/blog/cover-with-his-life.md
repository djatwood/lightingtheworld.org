*This is told in the perspective of Dr. Angie Sanchez, our LIGHT Director for Peru.










We conducted a LIGHT one month course in the Avenida Brasil SDA Church in Lima, Peru during the month of May, with 65 precious graduates. Here is a report from Dr. Angie Sanchez, our LIGHT Director for Peru:

The Lord continually opens doors for LIGHT in Lima, the beautiful capital of Peru. This time, it happened at the SDA church of Brazil Avenue, a large and active church. From May 1st through the 26th, a group of about 67 people attended the course. The participants were mostly from the vicinity of the church, although some had to make long commutes to attend the course. The interesting thing about the group, was that, several of the attendees were people who do not attend the Adventist Church, but who were very interested in the topics provided.

Personally, I was touched by Lili’s experience. She is a 38-year-old girl, who had been suffering from a very aggressive type of rheumatoid arthritis for 10 years. This led her to be prostrated and requiring the assistance of her mother, Gloria, a small but very powerful woman. Both faithfully attended classes throughout the month. Despite the difficult health situation and mobility limitations, both were sitting in the front row every day, smiling and eager to learn. I believe without a doubt, that they are a powerful testimony, in favor of the Lord. To be able to share with them, was a motivation and a great lesson of life and faith.
