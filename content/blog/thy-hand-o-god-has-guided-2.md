*This is told in the perspective of Bertha Mbengo and Mdunyiswa Ndhlela, two LIGHT students from Zimbabwe.









A word from Bertha:

My name is Bertha Mbengo, I am a 22-year old LIGHT student. During my training here at Tetbury, the living conditions were good. The food was well balanced and palatable. Its appearance was amazing. Lessons were well conducted throughout the course. As to outings, we enjoyed mingling with other missionaries and also learning from experienced missionary- minded individuals.

My favorite subjects were Christian Administration, Education, Ministry of Healing, Coming Events, and First Aid. I thank God for the love and guidance through the whole semester. I also thank God for the strength He granted us through our experience of working on the farm. I am planning to do the work that lies nearest while preparing for God&#8217;s guidance to lead me where my call is to represent Him to the world.

A word from Mdunyiswa:

In January, a lady with a cancerous wound on her leg came looking for help at our center. The case looked terrible and our hearts became faint. Unfortunately, her family could not afford our cancer program. They asked us to do our best with what we could obtain. In exchange, they promised to donate some food items and also ask for donations from their local SDA church in Bulawayo to help this lady who they have been praying for.

We prayed about this case, then got to work. We were forced to use the cheapest  

and most easy to find local herbs to dress the wound. We ended up using “silver cluster” and “african potato”, which we have plenty of, on our farm. We used a lot of hydrotherapy, hot and cold water, olive oil and flax seeds.

All this, coupled with correcting lifestyle habits and daily prayer, has yielded in supernatural results within just a few weeks. We have learned many lessons from this experience. Ruth, the patient we are caring for, still stays with us. Please pray for complete spiritual and physical healing.
