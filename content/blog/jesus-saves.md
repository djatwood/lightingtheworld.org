My family has experienced a kink in our plans but, we are happy to tell you how the Lord has been so good to us, every step of the way! Many of you may remember how my family, and I, had moved after we finished our 6-month Women&#8217;s Ministries course. We moved into a comfortable place to stay. Tom was assisting the local church in outreach and our whole family was making new friends in the community. While doing this, we worked on expanding our Nepali language abilities. One night, not long after our arrival in our new location, we were hiking back to our home with our groceries in our backpacks. As we climbed upward we could hear loud chanting, in unison, up the mountain from where we were. As we reached an intersection in the road, there was a police officer looking uphill. Tom looked and saw a large group of protesters, carrying fire-lit torches and chanting. As the people came closer Tom encouraged my wife and daughter to stand in the shadows of the side street as they passed by. When they passed by, we saw some of them violently tear down a sign that had been put up by the local government. The next day Tom asked our good friend, the lay leader of the Adventist church, what was happening. He explained the history of the local people and their desires. These people speak the Nepali language but are not Nepali citizens. However, they don&#8217;t feel they are treated fairly. So, as a result, they choose to protest in attempt to get their own independent state. This protest was in the form of a &#8220;strike,&#8221; which means that all the shops are supposed to close and the vehicles are supposed to stop running, until further notice. In this way, the frustrated protesters hoped to get the government&#8217;s attention in order to get what they desire. Some of the protests escalated into violence. The protests went from being peaceful, to yelling, throwing rocks and bricks, and finally to bullets. People were killed.

Police vehicles were burned. As we type this, the strike continues even today. It has been over 30 days. While we were in our new home, the strike continued. People were telling us it was a good idea for us, as foreigners, to leave. We felt safe in our home that God had provided. We were near a community that didn&#8217;t have anything to do with the strike. However, my family and I could tell as we looked around for food to eat, that the selection was getting smaller. No one could tell us how long the strike would last. The internet for the entire mountain region had been shut off. Those we met and talked to said that getting a vehicle to drive someone out of danger was impossible. Others said that we could get one to do it illegally in the night. We were beginning to feel less freedom and beginning to wonder if now was the time to go, rather than wait. We had planned to stay in our new home for almost two months. We had only been there for about three weeks. We went to our knees and prayed, asking God what we should do. After having one final Sabbath with our new church family, we decided we would try to leave. On Sunday morning, Tom and our church leader tried to go and talk to government officials to see if they could get some transportation for our family. They were told they were on our own to find something. They went to the protester office but it was closed. A couple of shady young men said they could provide a ride in the night, for a high price. The vehicle was secured, and a 4 am meeting time established. At our home, we had a lot to do. We took the whole day to separate our things into what we could take with us and what would be put into storage. We had some more trouble securing the vehicle, but by midnight we believed we would see a vehicle meeting us at 4 am, by God&#8217;s grace. We got up early, spent time with the Lord, and waited. Sure enough, the vehicle came! A fog came in, to our advantage, making us less conspicuous. Our driver took the back roads, and we were roughly driven through the streets, past burned out vehicles and flipped over buses. We arrived safely down the mountain. We proceeded down the mountain with our driver and got dropped off at a hotel that was out of the strike zone. There in the city, we had access to the internet and were able to contact Laymen Ministries, letting them know what was going on. They were able to help us acquire an early departure, back the United States. 










&#8220;Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.&#8221;  

Revelation 14:12.










As of now, we are scheduled to return to the country in early December, 2017. After all of this, we felt like Lot, as he was whisked away by the angels, out of Sodom. While these events were taking place around us, we were continually reminded how the Lord has told us that there will be a time of no buying or selling (Revelation 13:7). We thought over and over how we are told to live &#8220;out of the cities&#8221; (Country Living pg. 31). We feel as if we have had a taste of future trials which all those who &#8220;keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus&#8221; will have to face in the future. May God be with us all as we prayerfully examine our personal lives and the times that we live in.
