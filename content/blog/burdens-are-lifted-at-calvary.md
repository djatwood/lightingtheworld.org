*This story is told in the perspective of Dylan, a volunteer in Southern Asia. *











I was recently called to go to Southern Asia to the advanced tailoring course. I was interested in learning tailoring, and they needed someone to teach a couple classes on Bible subjects each day as well. So, things meshed perfectly. I would get to learn, and they would get someone to teach those classes. So, the beginning of the next week found me in Southern Asia. It has also been a good opportunity for me to improve my skills of speaking the native tongue in this region, since I would not have a translator present.  

I went for a walk one Sabbath afternoon and walked up above the village to a swinging bridge. It was a wonderful time in nature. On the way back, a lady stopped me and asked if I had some medicine for her shoulder. She said it made grating noises and hurt when she moved it. Occasionally it would seem as if it was getting better, but then she would have problems again. She couldn&#8217;t use it for work. I knew this wasn&#8217;t something that just medicine could fix. It had started four days before when trying to readjust her pillow at night. Something had happened inside that shoulder. That shoulder almost looked just a little different than the other one. I wondered if it might be dislocated, but couldn&#8217;t say anything for sure. It had been quite a while since I had read about dislocated shoulders, and I am also not a doctor and not qualified to fix such things. Medical facilities here also aren&#8217;t very good. Diseases may often be misdiagnosed, wrong medicines given, wrong dose of medicines given, or real problems overlooked.

I decided to do a little research, and in the meantime sent a young lady to give her a massage and do more careful checking to see what could be the real problem. The young ladies came back from the visit and told me that they didn&#8217;t think it was dislocated and didn&#8217;t know what was going on for sure. Nonetheless, they gave her a massage. The lady also told them she was planning on coming to our center for treatment in the evening. At this point, I wasn&#8217;t totally sure what to do. I was thinking that I would probably have to tell her she needed to go to the hospital to get an x-ray and official care. Interestingly enough, she didn&#8217;t come that evening. The next morning, I was thinking that maybe I would need to send someone to see her and encourage her to get it properly treated. She stopped by our facility with the joy of heaven on her countenance. That one massage had pretty much completely cured the problem. It would only occasionally bother her a little. She said that one of her relatives who had been telling her she needed to get an x-ray was very surprised at the outcome of this simple treatment. She got another massage and left very happy.  

I still don&#8217;t know for sure what was going on in that shoulder, but God used a simple massage and probably worked a miracle to heal it. I thank God for helping this lady when I didn&#8217;t know what to do.
