Hi Everybody,

What an exciting day we just had! Today was our first day of Health Expo. We crossed this jungle to reach the place. Men, I was trying not to think of the things that could be there in the bush alongside the trail. We crossed a little river and I almost fell in the muddy water &#8211; the thought of a crocodile jumping from the water could not leave me and helped me cross the river pretty quick. Then we arrived in this sweet village. It was my first Health Expo in a village through the jungle &#8211; nothing to see with the Health Expos I had experienced so far. Nothing happened the way we had planned. The students did really fine &#8211; I was proud of them. Then at the end we made an appeal for Bible studies (after the &#8220;Trust in God&#8221; (Mamwini Mungu) stand) and almost the all village wanted Bible studies! The students were busy writing the name of the people and distributing the first Bible studies drop-out. Tomorrow we have our second day and will go in another village just nearby. As we were coming back home, I decided to take the long way (and not the shortcut through the water) and the nurse who is with us also came. The students were singing hymns with their deep voices and it was very nice. Then I noticed a lady running past us like crazy. I asked a man who was there what was going on. He said that a lady was having some big health issues over there. I told him to show me where it was because we had a doctor with us &#8211; Dr Grivas was just ahead of us. Then we realized that the lady was having a baby: she was in the village with us for the health expo and felt her time for the baby coming and tried to walk fast to the local health center (where people often die after any operation) but she did not make it and she had to stop in a little abandoned hut and the baby started to come. But they had a problem: they did not have anything to cut the umbilical cord and she was worrying. Then we showed up. I had my Swiss knife in my backpack and, after cleaning it with hand sanitizer, we went to the lady &#8211; the little baby boy was coming out of the uterus! So impressive ! So beautiful ! Bridgette cut the cord after making sure that everything was in place (she had just taken some midwifery classes in her nursing classes and in Wildwood) and they tied it with whatever they use there and the baby was safe. The mother was really thankful &#8211; she could stand right away and wanted to go home. What a day!!  

We were all thankful that the Lord had used us in a powerful way with the Health message to be a blessing to others.

Sunday is our outreach day and the students will go there to Village Huit and give Bible studies. Another team will be out to clear the way for the construction of the church there (Congo Frontline Missions have already bought a property there and there is no church whatsoever there. It was the first Adventist action in that village) and we will put up the One-Day-Church material. We are really excited about this. Our evangelistic series will start in 3 weeks !

Thank you for your prayer. The students were happy, although some of them are suffering with diarrhea, headaches, etc. We are administering a lot of guava/papaya/mango leaves tea with Euphorbia and charcoal, garlic, etc. Tomorrow one of the students is going to the lab to be tested for Thyphoid and Amoeba. I hope he has none. His name is Dieudonné Osanba. Thank you for keeping him in your prayers. Last week I had a bad episode of diarrhea and it went after a few days of this tea and one day of charcoal and prayer. Our Lord is working. It is nice to be on the front line of God&#8217;s work &#8230;
