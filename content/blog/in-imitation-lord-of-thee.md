Because of the spiritual desolateness of this area, there have been two graduates that have been placed in a seminary program as full-time bible workers. Saul and Rob work closely with the lay evangelist pastor of the SDA church nearby. Saul and Rob have been working for the Lord primarily through friendship evangelism and home visitation which has led to bible studies and baptisms. Friendship evangelism involves the Bible workers reaching out to members of the community and befriending them. As the friendship and trust grows, the door is open to discussions of health, faith and Bible studies. This is followed by invitations to come to church. They go out each day on foot or on bicycle and visit homes, hospitals and church members. They meet new people and make new contacts for Bible studies. Many of their contacts come from local church members. This area has a great deal of underground terrorist activity. When Saul first moved into his new community in September 2015, many of his neighbors were not friendly to him and were actually afraid he was a terrorist. He spoke their language with an accent and did not act like most locals.

Eventually, they began to talk to him but they were still very guarded. They started to offer him tea and he would say no. Although it can seem rude to decline tea, this was actually a blessing in that it gave him the perfect opportunity to share the health message. Sometime later, a Hindu holiday came around and his neighbors offered him food that is usually offered to Hindu gods. 










&#8220;Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity&#8221;  

1 Timothy 4:12.










He declined and yet they still put it on his table. He refused to eat any food that had been offered to a pagan god and threw it away. His neighbors again asked why and he was then able to share with them about the true creator God and that he would not dishonor Him by eating this particular food. His neighbors were not angry and respected his decision. After this time of getting to know him, they realized that he is actually a devout young man that lives according to the principles he has learned from the Bible. Some of his neighbors work for the government and the salary is occasionally not paid on time. When this happened, his neighbors asked to borrow money until their pay came. Saul agreed and then they paid him back. Saul says that now his neighbors are very happy with him and freely share their words and time with him.
