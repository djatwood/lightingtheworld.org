LIGHT offers short courses in medical missionary work at various churches, online, or at a LIGHT school nearby. LIGHT courses are designed to train missionaries with the knowledge and practical experience necessary in order to minister to the needs of communities and individuals physically, mentally and spiritually. It has proved to be a blessing to go out and share the beautiful messages of health evangelism, worldwide. Shanniel Fisher, one of our divisional directors, has been busy conducting one month training courses throughout the Inter-American division. Everything has been going quite well and many students are eager to take LIGHT training courses, globally.










&#8220;Declare His glory among the nations, His wonders among all peoples.&#8221;  

Psalms 96:3.










We have been able to shine our LIGHT in the beautiful country of Honduras. We have 4 zones in this area. Fortunately, there are many individuals who have been eager to learn more about natural remedies, vegetarian cooking classes and much more! As Shanniel and his coworkers present our courses, they are continually astounded by the receptiveness of the people. Through much prayer and diligence, the individuals have been responsive to the truths that are being presented to them.

When all had been said and done, almost 250 students graduated from the training courses! Praise the Lord! Although it is always reassuring to know that yet another course has been completed, there is still much work to be done in the Inter-American Division. Next stop: Guatemala. Please pray that the Lord will shower His richest blessings over the training schools all over the world in preparation for His soon return.
