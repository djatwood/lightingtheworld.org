Hello to all from North India,

By God’s grace we were able to complete a three week medical missionary program in Hazaribagh, Jharkhand in the month of February. The training was held in the second floor of a midwifery clinic that Springs of Joy has been running for several years. Even though the number of students was less than expected it was still very much enjoyable with what God blessed us with. It was also a blessing for us to have in addition to the seven students that were sent two from the community also attended. It is always nice for students from different places and back grounds meet together and learn about God because you are able to see positive changes taking place in their lives as they make choices to follow what they learn. The two students from the community, one a Hindu and the other a Muslim, really enjoyed the things that they were learning about Christianity. Khushboo,the Hindu student, told us that whatever she was learning in the classes she was sharing with her family. When we had a session about using charcoal powder, she eagerly ask if she could have some to take home. The same thing was repeated when she learned about blood pressure. She had to take a BP cuff home to check her family and share how to keep the blood pressure healthy. God is really inspiring honest people from other persuasions with a burden to know and understand His truths, and He is putting them in contact with his people to guide them.

The other students who had been sent to take the training we assumed were Adventist, however we found out that some had not been baptized members. A call was given in one of the classes for those who had not accepted Christ before and would like to and be baptized to raise their hands. Thinking only of the two from the community who we knew were not Adventist, I was surprises that three of the other students raised their hands. We found out later a couple days after the program that the young couple that were there were also Hindu. It was truly amazing that all the time they were there we did not know. The other surprising thing is that there were no outward signs that they were also. We thank God again that He is sending his people from other folds to learn his truth from his people. Pretam Singh was another one that made a decision for baptism. We ask that you keep them in your prayers along with the two that attended from the community that they will be faithful to their decisions.  

This next month from April 7 we will be starting another training program in the same location. By God’s grace we will have reached our goal for the number of attendees. We ask that you pray for the attendees and the teachers that will be involved in the program that God will guide the teacher and that the students mind will be open to fully understand.

We are also needing a second cook for the kitchen during the training, so please don’t forget to include that as well.

God bless you as you keep this project in prayer,  

Sincerely,

Andrew Jones
