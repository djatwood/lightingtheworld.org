One of the immediate tasks the LIGHT team set out in this training program was to implement community outreach each evening with the students, going door to door and conducting community health surveys, a practical demonstration of the reality of the right arm of the gospel in opening the hearts of the people.

Medical missionary work brings to humanity the gospel of release from suffering. It is the pioneer work of the gospel. It is the gospel practiced, the compassion of Christ revealed. Of this work there is great need, and the world is open for it. God grant that the importance of medical missionary work shall be understood, and that new fields may be immediately entered.
