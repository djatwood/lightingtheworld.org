### First Anniversary Serra do Cipo Lifestyle Center since July 2015

Serra do Cipo Lifestyle Center was founded May 7th 2014 as a non-profit organization in order to receive a property donation over in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. That day we begun to pray and plan to start a Lifestyle center and Missionary school. On July 26,2015 we started the first one-month LIGHT school. This was just the beginning. Since then we have held:(4) additional one-month LIGHT courses; (8) Lifestyle Education Programs; Education and Family Seminars; and training sessions for church officials.

**Medical Missionary School**

July 30th marked the end of our 5th one- month LIGHT course. And as is our custom, the students shared their testimonies. It was an encouraging event! During this time of rededication and praise a young man stood up to share his testimony. This man suffered from asthma and had to take his medication daily. But after a few days of participating in the activities, food, and classes he was able to lay aside his medications without any ill effect. The simpler lifestyle and change of ambient had definitely aided in his feeling better.

**Medical Missionary**

This last group has been our biggest yet! We had a total of32 students from young to old and from varying walks of life. For us it is like having a huge family where we all study together. eat together. work together. worship together. do ministry together. Even the student&#8217;s kids get to participate a number of the activities; else they are happily playing and cheering us with their happy spirit. The classes we include in our curriculum have been taught with a Christ-centered focus whether it be in Agriculture. Nutrition. Daniel and Revelation. or Church History. As our students come and participate in the programs many have testified to the life-changing and positive influence they have experienced. During these past five courses. three of them were baptized and many others overcame depression. addictions. and lukewarm spirituality.

**Lifestyle Education Program**

By faith we begun our Lifestyle Education Programs last September 2015. At the time there were still many things to be done; the hydrotherapy department was just 40% finished and many rooms needed to be furnished. As we used what we had on hand we witnessed how the Lord blessed and multiplied our effort and resources. To date over 60 guests have come to our facility to loose weight. control their blood pressure. stabilize blood sugar levels. or overcome addiction. depression. and insomnia. But aside of the many physical conditions from which they recovered many of the patients would say that &#8220;I came here to get physical health but I received something better; spiritual healing.·

Our mission is to fulfill the Great Commission that God has given us. And to fulfill this calling we realize that we need to work in the spirit of unity; adding our work and efforts to the other many thousands of workers who have dedicated their lives to serve our Lord. In volume 9 of the Testimonies we read that.










&#8216;The work of God in this earth can never be finished until the men and women comprising our church membership rally to the work and unite their efforts with those of ministers and church officers.  

{9T 116.4}&#8221;

**Preparing to finish the work**

God&#8217;s providence led us to unite with the Conference Health Director from the Southeast Brazilian Union. Pr. Elmir. He asked us to help give some pastors and church leaders health education training. So this past July we hosted the annual meetings for the Union&#8217;s health and treasury directors.16 pastors joined us from 9 of Brazil&#8217;s conferences. They were very excited to learn methods by which they could use the health message to strengthen their congregations. We thank God for what He has done so far and are thrilled at the results we have seen. But we cannot yet rest in that content because we know that God wants to use us to do an even greater work. We are also very thankful for your support to this ministry. Your partnership has allowed us to finish the hydrotherapy department: to build wardrobes in half of the rooms: to equipped our kitchen with cupboards. table and refrigerator: and to equip our classroom with new seats. a screen board. and others small improvements.

**Volunteers housing**

As we begin this second year of operation we have renewed our energies to face the upcoming challenges. We have already begun the construction of7 bedrooms to house the volunteers and students. After almost a year since we started the application to dig a well. we recently got the government permit to dig it. Our well will soon be completed. We&#8217;ve already accepted five students and they are currently helping us for their work scholarship.Their six month medical missionary training will begin in January 30 2017. We still need $10.000 to finish the volunteers housing project. We ask you to prayfully consider to support this project.

All throughout this first year we have had many opportunities to witness the power of God revealed in His ability to change people&#8217;s lives. And for us it is a high privilege to take part in this work. So as we recount what has taken. we are overjoyed for what has been accomplished. But we also understand that this work cannot stop as it is: we hope that it should advance to further and finish the gospel work. And for that we request your prayers and support.

May God bless you richly!
