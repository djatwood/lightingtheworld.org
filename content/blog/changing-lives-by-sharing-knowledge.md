As told by Manoah Agayong, West Africa Regional Director for LIGHT










Testimony from a student:  

I was born into an Adventist family and suddenly became a victim of the social problem of divorced parents at the age of six (6), a terrible situation I found myself. As if that was not enough for me, to worsen the situation I lost both parents (late). So, I then became carried away with the struggle of life in order to survive, considering the fact that I have no parents.

I was just living my life regardless of the things above and the things afterlife. I was just trying to chase the world day by day. I read the Bible as if am reading the newspaper, the mentality I had is that…. “I am an Adventist the true Church, am on the right track” not knowing that I have been an Adventist verbally without actually being aware that it comes with a huge task to be part of the Remnant Church.

While growing, at a tender age I often hear about EG. White and series of her writings on Prophesy, Health Evangelism and Reformation, that I can remember vividly. But the teaching was painted in a way that few individuals that embarked in it were even being despised. After my university education, I developed an interest in joining the Adventist Medical Missionary Training; but was so reluctant about it until March 2019. I finally made up my mind to enroll in LIGHT (Lay Institute for Global Health Training) for the essential training.

Since I enrolled in this training, my life has not remained the same; Biblically my knowledge and understanding have improved, nutrition and diet-wise I am gradually adjusting in order to live a healthy life for my spirituality to be stronger.

This program has also broadened my horizon both Spiritually and Healthwise. I also realized that the Gospel cannot succeed until we adopt Christ&#8217;s method in spreading the message. Most importantly, how to apply a simple natural remedy to treat common illnesses and diseases which will go a long way in drawing people to God.

This training has transformed my heart, my mind also renewed and I have established a relationship with God that I won’t trade for anything because my faith has grown stronger.

Finally, I appreciate God Almighty, the world leadership of the Seventh-day Adventist Church and the Lay Institute Global Health Training (LIGHT) for this program. I also appreciate the effort of my self-supporting instructors; Mr. &amp; Mrs. Manoah Agayong, Mr. Benjamin Agayong and Mr. Joseph for the selfless service of spreading the Gospel. And for taking time out of their tight schedule to Teach and Mentor throughout this training.
