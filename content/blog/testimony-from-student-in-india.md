My name is Rajni Minz and I come from the state of Orissa, in India.

I was born to Roman Catholic parents. When I was six years old my family converted to Seventh &#8211; day Adventism. My friends would tease me when I went to school since I did not go on Sabbath and my teachers would also ask on Monday why I didn’t come to school Saturdays. When I would tell them that I was attending church they would ask if Sabbath was more important. Even after changing school I could not get Sabbath off even though my father requested so to the principle. The school followed the Hindu religion and worshiped idols. The students had to pray and worship the idols. When I refused to eat the food offered to idols they would ask why I didn’t and I would tell them the Bible say that it is not good to eat things offered to idols. The teachers would say nothing would happen to me if I ate the food, but I still did not eat. I was baptized in the year 2006. The same principle who refused to give me Sabbath off then allowed me to have Sabbath off.

Once I fell sick and the Lord healed me.

I thank God.
