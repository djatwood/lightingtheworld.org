God blessed us with a delightful LIGHT school in San Rafael, Argentina, in the district where Gabriel Paschetta and Brenda Loose are beginning a wellness center. A motivated, eager group of students participated in the training, and at the end held a health expo with over 235 attending and 50 Bible study requests. They are actively following up with Bible studies and other health programs at the present. The property that Gabriel and Brenda hope to transform into a lifestyle center and school is ideal, with 5 furnished cabins that will house guests and a clinic, an attractive cafeteria and kitchen, well-kept grounds, as well as 2 hectares of plums that are already bearing, and rich agricultural soil. Please join with me in praying that God may supply the resources so that this may become a reality soon.

Programs were held across Chile from the middle of March to the middle of April, organized by the Union health director—from Antofagasta up in the far north desert region, to Temuco in the south, over to Concepción, and in Los Angeles for 2 weeks at the Adventist Clinic. God blessed tremendously, awakening in many hearts a desire to work faithfully for Him using health as a gracious opening wedge. I was so encouraged to see physicians, teachers, and many others attending night after night, and expressing their desire that God may use them more powerfully. I believe that God is coming soon, and it is a joy to see so many laypersons from many professions and walks of life ready and willing to be used by the Lord.
