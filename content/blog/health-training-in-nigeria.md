The Health Evangelism Training ended recently in Saminaka, Nigeria. There were 42 participants in the third of four sessions, which means they just have one more session left to do in order to complete the full course and receive their certificates!

They taught several classes and were also able to do a health expo on a weekday, with almost 100 people coming in for screening and counseling, including SDA&#8217;s, Non-SDA&#8217;s and even a Muslim. They tested for Hepatitis B &#038; C as well as HIV at the health expo aside from the usual.
