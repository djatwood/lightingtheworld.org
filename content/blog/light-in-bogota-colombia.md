LIGHT had the opportunity to do another one month course in Bogotá, Colombia this year. God has been blessing the work tremendously allowing us to work with the association in doing weekend trainings as well as the full one month training while there. We spent some time laying future plans to working together on a more permanent basis with a travel team to do health evangelism training in the churches. Please pray that if it be God&#8217;s will to have a training team in Colombia, that he would also provide the people with the abilities and training necessary in order to make it happen.

 We were also able to discuss further the needs and opportunities of two projects that are currently working toward affiliation. We were able to have a one month course at one of the affiliates, and as time permitted, we were able to plan another one month course for July.

 It is amazing to see how God is leading so many people to open projects and training centers in different parts of the world, but especially when there is enough interest to begin several training centers in the same country with the full support of the local church.
