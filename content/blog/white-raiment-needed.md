The Lord just open up another year for us, and it is with deep gratitude that we have express to the Lord for the year 2013 that He has blessed the medical missionary work in the Philippines.

Before 2013 year ends, we celebrated our annual camp meeting at Nueva Era, Ilocos Norte themed White Raiment Required. We were visited by our medical missionary alumni from their different mission fields, different supporting ministries, local district pastors, director of the local mission, SSD Sabbath School director Pastor Hermogenes Villanueva, and by our guest speakers no other than the President of OCI, Steven Grabiner, president of ASI-NAD Frank Fournier, and the ASI-SSD past president David Tan.

The camp meeting&#8217;s objective is to promote spiritual life among God&#8217;s people&#8230;God has committed to our hands a most sacred work, and we need to meet together to receive instruction, that we may be fitted to perform this work.

The speakers focuses their message to the Righteousness by Faith subject that is very needed by His people in the last days. Indeed, we were all blessed by the shared and spoken Word of God.

One of the highlight as well of this program, is that it was conducted at the lifestyle center building, though it is not yet ready to accommodate guest and patients but God is able to make this center available to be the venue for the said program.

God be praised on this year end program of Better Way Foundation and LIGHT Philippines, and as we start another year. May God help us to be more faithful as we start another year, may we always work under the blood stained banner of our Lord Jesus.

Servant for Christ&#8217;s sake,
