Founded as a place of healing with the motto, “For a life with God,” Country Life Institute – Austria was established in 2008. Located near the Italian-Slovenian border, the ministry has experienced success in secular Western Europe with God’s help. As Europeans recognize their urgent need for experiencing total restoration, more and more medical missionaries have an open door to share the good news of salvation in Jesus Christ.

Country Life began as a training school. Approximately 12 students are accepted annually for the yearlong course, which focuses on making the students learning experience practical so they are able to establish their own ministry or work as lifelong missionaries. More than 100 students have completed the training.

In addition to the school, Country Life runs a health center which hosts up to eleven sessions each year. Under close mentorship, each student benefits from the hands-on participation with the guests. Also, the family environment of the health center provides personal and individualized care. Currently the health center receives almost 100 guests per year, half of whom are not Seventh-day Adventists. A wide variety of public programs and outreach activities are offered in the community and for interested church members. Here is a short testimony from a former graduate:

Country Life praises God for this success and continues to pray for more land to expand the ministry.
