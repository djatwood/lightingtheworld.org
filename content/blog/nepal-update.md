&#8220;One of the most exciting bits of news here is that we have an Evangelical pastor who has been a member of this class from day one. He has not missed even one class! And just yesterday he announced (thru translation) that he wants to join the SDA church!!! He is changing his diet and want to follow the message that he has heard! He also wants us to come to his church and give the same training&#8230; We will have to work on that one&#8230;

Some other news  &#8211;  each Sabbath pastor Danny has taken us to another village to give the message! Sometimes travel by bus and jeep to places that one can wonder where, but the people are there! Sunday afternoons we have visited local villages by foot and done health counseling with the people. We have seen hundreds of people over the weeks. And since we are near to pastor Danny&#8217;s school, many of the children visit now and then. We were asked to do some classes just for the young people also, so we packed them in the church building for about 2 hours and Linda spoke with them about issues in their level.

Some other bits  &#8211;  we had 2 nights of elephant scares &#8211; where elephants have come through looking for food &#8211; bananas, etc. They have only been about a 1/4 mile from where we are and we saw some of the damage they made. God blessed and no one was hurt. Other nights we have been awakened by a &#8220;priest&#8221; that comes and marches around the buildings playing some flute like instruments and chanting &#8211; apparently chasing away evil spirits. I sometimes have wondered who will chase him away&#8230;  

The dogs are very active at night keeping the wildcats away from the livestock  &#8211;  every home has animals around it. So there are many nights that sleep is running on the slim side.&#8221;

May God bless you and be with you and your families,

Michael Teti and the &#8220;Nepal Team&#8221;
