This is told from the perspective of Dr. Kim, a LIGHT worker in Bolivia. 










When we placed our feet on the soil of Bolivia a little more than 7 years ago, we had no idea what plans God had for our little ministry that we were planning to start. We heard the call of God for our family of 5 to come to Bolivia to start a medical missionary training school. After several delays, we finally sold everything we had, left our careers and arrived eager to “bear the ark of the Lord” in an unfamiliar place, culture, people and language. After many trials and hardships, we can look back and be certain that God had protected us, guided us, but most of all we can see the hand of God moving to orchestrate the details of our lives in order to accomplish His will through us in this foreign land. Our mouth is full of His blessings. We can only give Him praise for all that He has done and is still doing here in Bolivia. Recently I, with our team from Instituto Quebrada León, had an opportunity to do a one week health program giving health talks, cooking classes, and health consultations at the Adventist Church just one short block from the Adventist Bolivian Union building. Out of the countless stories, let me briefly share just a few. First, many of the church leaders and pastors came to see what we were doing. Some came to speak with us because someone in their family was sick and needed help and wanted to send their family members to our lifestyle center.

Others wanted to come to our yearly 10 day program for pastors that we started this year in January and wanted to make sure we would have a spot for them this coming January. Some of the pastors wanted to participate in our 1 month LIGHT program, which has become amazingly popular, with more and more people wanting to come every year. Two meetings stand out in my mind. One was with the President of the Adventist Bolivia Union, the Director of the Evangelism Department, and the Director of Health and Publications, all from the Adventist Bolivian Union. The three of them sat down with one of our volunteers and I, and I was able to explain why we are here in Bolivia. I told them how God called us to leave everything in the US and come to Bolivia to start our ministry and the call to work with the church leadership. After the meeting, the leaders looked at each other and decided that they would like to visit our campus and set a date for August to show their support for the work we were doing. As this meeting was ending, the Director of Evangelism asked to speak with us in his office. He promised that he would be our greatest supporter and promised also to give us Bibles and any other evangelistic materials we needed to help us advance the work we are doing here in Bolivia. Right after this meeting, we had another memorable meeting with the Director of Education Adventist Bolivian Union.










&#8220;I am the Lord thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt: open thy mouth wide,and I will fill it.&#8221;  

Psalms 81:10.










He was so excited to meet with us. We spent couple of hours with him and with his assistant director, planning and speaking about the educational system in our Adventist schools in Bolivia, and they asked if we could work together to bring the health message into our schools. He said he wants to have 3-4 schools in different parts of Bolivia as pilot schools next year and then the following year implement them in all of the schools. What arrested our attention was when he said, “si o si” (literal translation: “yes or yes”, meaning there is no option) we will implement this plan in our Adventist University next year because he said this is where we are forming our future pastors and church leaders.  Praise God for opening this door for us to enter the university through this visionary leader, the Director of all of the Adventist educational institutions in Bolivia.

Of course I said yes, for I had personally been praying for this opportunity for a long time.

Right in that meeting God reminded me of a verse that I had been claiming constantly. Jeremiah 33:3 “Call unto me, and I will answer thee, and shew thee great and mighty things, which thou knowest not.”

Wow, I had been calling upon God and He was faithful in answering my prayers and showing me great and mighty things that I had not known.










&#8220;And it shall come to pass, as soon as the soles of the feet of the priests that bear the ark of the Lord, the Lord of all the earth, shall rest in the waters of Jordan, that the waters of Jordan shall be cut off from the waters that come down from above; and they shall stand upon an heap.&#8221;  

Joshua 3:13.










We had many more divine appointments during this week, but the lesson for us in supporting ministry work is to move forward bearing the “ark of the Lord” (this is critical but we did not have time to elaborate on this part), claiming His promises and then open our mouths wide waiting for God to fill it to the brim.

Now our greatest need is humble hearts with the wisdom of God to know how best to proceed with all of the requests we have been receiving.

We also know that the devil is angry with what is happening here in Bolivia and will do what he can to stop this, so we need prayers that no matter what happens we would be faithful and persevere to the end.
