Philip shares his personal testimony from a recent medical missionary course:

First of all I would like to thank you all very much for helping to establish this institute. While I am here I feel like I am having the taste of heaven, with so much spiritual environment and it’s a pattern according to the scripture and Spirit of Prophecy.

All the experiences here takes my thoughts back to the school of prophets and their experiences. For this institute is like a modern school of prophets where visionary people could come and be well equipped and trained to be servants to their fellow brothers. My words fail to express my thankfulness for all your resources, prayers and hand of support. God has sent you all as the powerful instruments to finish the race.

Before being here I was privileged to visit different corners of Nepal as a Bible worker, carrying the messages of cross on my shoulder.  More I knocked the doors and tried to enter into their hearts I realized that if I could have some basic knowledge of Medical ministry I could reach much more people in most effective way. Since, in Nepal we do not have even one medical missionary center my hope soon turned into despair.  So day after day I was on my knees pleading God to guide my steps.

Not after long of this experience, I had a privilege to meet brother Joshua Subash in one of our youth program. That’s when he explained me about this institute, and the mission of it. From that very conversation I wanted to join here and be trained as God wants me to be. Through lots of prayers and much fasting God has led me here.

Now I have a burden to reach thousands of souls that are crying with no hope in a little country called ‘Nepal’. I have been praying day and night to have a lifestyle center/ medical missionary center in Nepal where people could come and be trained.

Why it is urgent to reach this place with the work of Medical Missionary:-

Total Population of Nepal is 27.5 Million

(Adventist Membership) Number of Seventh-day Adventists Members in Nepal: 8,000*

Adventists to population ratio: 1:3,437

(*General Conference Office of Archives and Statistics, 147th Annual Statistical Report, 2011.)

The above information gives us a glimpse of how much work is to be done, how many people are still to be reached with the Adventist Message.  How is it possible? How is it that this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all corners of Nepal with so few labourers? Is there any solution for this great problem?

“As the medical missionary works intelligently to receive suffering and save life, hearts are softened. Those who are helped are filled with gratitude. As the medical missionary works upon the body, God works upon the heart. The comforting words that are spoken are as a soothing balm, bringing assurance and trust. This gospel message, connected with practical missionary work, will be a saver of life unto life. The soul will be saved through belief in Christ.”   Battle Creek Letters (1928) P.42

Understanding the importance of this ministry we would like to have one of the centers like this in the country Nepal. While pleading to the Lord, He has been impressing us to go there to lay the foundations. Our plan is to go there as a mission trip with all the students and few staffs and conduct health expo for one month with the mission to serve them, care for them, and point them to the cross. 

But this is impossible with the human efforts only, for we are moving with empty bags yet filled with faith that God will surely provide the needed resources. Please have this in your prayers and if God impresses you to help, many souls would be brought in the feet of Jesus through your sacrifices.

In His Service,

Philip
