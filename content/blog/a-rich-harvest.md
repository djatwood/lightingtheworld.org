January 30, 2016 was a day of celebration here at Lifestyle Center Serra do Cipo. Over fifty visitors came to the graduation and joined us as we lifted up praise and worship to God for the great blessing granted us during our third medical missionary course.  

The challenges began early this time. During the registration period certain circumstances presented themselves that made us realize our lack in ability to accomplish the work of the Lord. This realization led us to cry out to God for wisdom; and the answer was clear:


&#8220;For the Lord seeth not as man sees, for man sees what is before his eyes, but the Lord looks at the heart.”  

1 Samuel 16: 7


&nbsp;

On the third of January, we welcomed a very atypical and visibly diverse class. In the classroom we had all ages; from teenagers to young adults, middle-aged and elderly. Some were recovering addicts while others were physically ill. We had students who were non-Adventists and one students was even an ordained pastor. With all this diversity we were assured that only the Holy Spirit could meet their different needs.  

Adding yet another reason for us to get on our knees and cry out in prayer. During the first week, one of our volunteers had nightmares or visions of angels trying to suffocate her. Further reminding us that:


“We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.”  

Ephesians 6:12


&nbsp;

We recognized our inability to win this conflict and sought refuge in our great commander. So for the following days we carried out a prayer chain that lasted through the night.

Not before long, miracles begun taking place. During the first Friday vespers we had the opportunity to hear several testimonies. A young man who was going astray into the darkness of this world expressed his gratitude towards God for allowing him the opportunity to come to the mission school and consecrate his life to God.  

When Diana arrived she could barely walk even with the aid of her crutches. With progressive exercise she ended up leaving her crutches altogether and would go on long walks alone. During her stay she was put on a special 14 day juice fast after which she confessed that it had been over a year since she had felt as well and energetic as she did now.

For several years Elenice’s diet had consisted of taking 14 pills every day. Shortly after her arrival she stopped taking her medications. The best part was that because of the changes in her lifestyle, her blood pressure stabilized at 120/80. Her blood glucose, which had been 275 on arrival, went down to 95 towards her last days here. Elenice also wept with joy when she realized that she had not “lost” (because what is lost can be found) but rather thrown out 18 lbs.

Lucas, a 18 year old who made his living composing popular music, was convicted during the first week here that he should devote his talents to God’s service. On graduation day he sealed his decision to live for Christ in the waters of baptism.  

Wallace is a young man who after many disappointments in life had lost faith. He later told us that after his first day at Serra do Cipó he was wanting to escape and leave the place!

Throughout the month the Holy Spirit worked to soften his heart and he too reconsecrated his life and was re-baptized. Now, after having graduated from the medical missionary course, he is making plans to return as a volunteer.

Perpetua has cancer in her lungs, brain, and abdomen. Upon arriving to the missionary school she could barely feed herself. Within just a few days she was on a steady dietary schedule, eating three nutritious meals a day. She testified that she had come to the Lifestyle Center Serra do Cipo in hopes of finding physical healing but that along with increased knowledge in living a better lifestyle she had found something better; spiritual healing through a closer relationship with Jesus.

Each of the 23 students who completed the medical missionary school expressed their gratitude to God for using this ministry to help them understand the divine plan for their lives. It is only with God’s strength and power that we are able to move forward.

We also would like to thank you those who donated for the kitchen renovations. Our needs now shift to the cafeteria where we are in need of new tables and chairs; and for windows to enclose the eating area. The estimated cost of this will be around $10,000.
