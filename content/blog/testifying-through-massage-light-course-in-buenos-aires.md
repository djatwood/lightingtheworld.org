March was the month we had our first LIGHT course in Argentina. It was a month full of trials and challenges. It was a month full of positive experiences and blessings. A population of approximately 16 million between the Capital and Buenos Aires converts this city into a megalopolis of the country. This generates the need to travel long distances and slow transit times through heavy traffic. But none of this stopped any of the 130 persons that registered for the course. Every night there were more than 100 participants in the group, all with a deep desire to learn about evangelism and health.

On one of these nights, in the massage class, they were given the assignment of giving at least 4 massages during the week. They could give the massages to family members, friends, neighbors, or whoever the students associated with. It was by this means that the participants decided to complete their massage practice assignment on their coworkers, being that they were the people they spent the most time with. One of their coworkers, of Jewish religion, being surprised by the massage received, asked to what they owed the attention given. It was then that God opened the door to share the message. The student from the LIGHT course took advantage of the opportunity to share with her about the Seventh-Day Adventist Church and how she was taking a course on health. This generated a great interest in her coworker, who then asked if she could go to the meetings as well. So during the remainder of the programs they were both a part of the active group that went to the Palermo church, in Capital Federal.

God uses simple instruments, as simple as a massage, to open the door of the hearts of people. They need to know Jesus. This Jesus that came to where the needy were, showing interest for the people, taking care of their needs and gaining their confidence. This is how he got to the heart of the people, and they followed him.

Jesus Said: &#8220;Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.&#8221; Matthew 11:28
