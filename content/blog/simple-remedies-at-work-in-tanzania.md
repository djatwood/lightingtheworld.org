Here is a heartwarming report from East Africa &#8211; showing how effective God&#8217;s simple remedies can be!

At the wellness center we have a guest who was suffering from severe incontinence and constipation for years spending all her money on various doctors only to get worse each time.  Someone sent her the bus fare so she came to us.  After only two weeks she has full control of her bladder, regularity in her other functions, greatly reduced pain and bloating. She is so happy and thankful.  She is Catholic, and she has been reading the Swahili Steps to Christ that is in her room.  We praise God for what He is doing for her.

Prayer request: Safety and a sure witness to all as we go on furlough for the next three months.  Power to encourage those God wants us to encourage.  We expect a very high profile guest at the wellness center next week.  PLEASE PRAY for 100% recovery from his diabetes.  He is the brother of one of the most influential health leaders in the country.  When God moves to heal this man, it will open doors all over Tanzania for God’s healing methods to be taught, and ultimately, His saving love!
