Manoah, our west Africa regional director writes:

We need prayers for 3 things especially:  

1. Our plan for West Africa  

2. Our desire to register LIGHT West Africa with the corporate affairs commission of Nigeria as we explore ways to be self supporting  

3. For us to run a 6months training in Northern Nigeria soon God willing.

Please continue to pray for this project.
