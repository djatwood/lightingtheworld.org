Oftentimes, several people go out to the city to accomplish various things such as the weekly grocery shopping, selling baked goods from our bakery, purchasing construction material, etc. On this particular day they had the trailer loaded with several large bags of Cassava. Most of the time the people ride in the back where we have seats installed so more people can be taken to the various activities we have with more comfort. There were three people in the back, which is completely isolated from the cab of the truck, and one young man decided to hop out. The driver was not aware that anyone had left due to the view of the back from the driver’s seat, so he started the engine and prepared to move the vehicle. A second person decided he was also going to jump out at this time, so he jumped from the back of the truck onto the trailer hitch bar that separates the hitch from the actual trailer. He was planning on launching himself from that point onto the ground far away from the vehicle-but his foot slipped, and he found himself very close to the then slowly moving vehicle-too close in fact, and he quickly realized that his head was in the path of the trailer’s tire. He saw the tire coming his way and immediately curled himself up into a ball in an effort to protect himself right before the trailer weighing approximately 1,000 Ibs ran over his head. In a few moments, the driver realized he ran over something and stopped the vehicle.

After getting up and finding his glasses which he remembers having on his head after he fell, but afterward found a little ways from the road in the grass, he came back to the then parked truck. The then only student left in the back of the truck asked him “Did you thank the person that helped you up?” to which he received the reply “What person? There wasn’t anyone else there.” Could it be that an Angel helped him up and also put his glasses away from the rolling wheel where they could be found completely unbroken and usable afterward?

This young man walked away from this incident with only a tiny scratch on his face from where the tire ran over him with no side affects whatsoever. When we work for God and follow Him, he takes care of us, not only in the big things but also in the small. Even when things seem to be but a minor detail such as a pair of glasses, he knows what we need in order to do His work. We serve a great and compassionate God, don’t we? What are you doing to help others understand the compassionate and loving God we serve that even something as small as a pair of glasses is important to Him?
