We praise God that many of our team members have arrived from around the world to various countries throughout Africa safely!  (although several had delayed flights and lost luggage)  Some are still traveling so please keep them in your prayers.  Please especially pray for our team going to Congo tomorrow January 4.  They will be taking 50 DVD players for the New Beginnings and Abundant Living training and we hope their will be no problems going through customs.  These will be fantastic tools to bless many people throughout the country.  They should be at the airport January 4 around noon Congo time so please make special note to pray for them.

Thank you again for all your prayers and support!
