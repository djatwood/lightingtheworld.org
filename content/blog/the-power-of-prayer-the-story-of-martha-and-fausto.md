The Centro de Aplicaciones Vida Sana (translated as Center of Healthy Life Applications, referred to as CAViS,) was created inside of the Adventist School of Ecuador. It&#8217;s objective has been to give practical training to students from the Health Promotion Career as well as taking the message of salvation to the community through health. They mostly offer hydrotherapy and massage treatments.

His turn was at 3:30 pm. And they were punctual every day. Their names, Martha and Fausto. They started to come because he started to have back pain, and his son, a physician, indicated that they should come to CAViS. When they finished the treatment that day, his wife asked if next time they could give it to both of them. So she started to go as well.

As of a few months ago, Martha had been receiving chemotherapy due to a cancer they had discovered, and she was under the secondary effects that tends to come with it. So we started to work together.

As an institution, they had adopted a precious custom. Every day at 10am and 4pm could be heard the song &#8220;Talk with God&#8221; so that all could hear and at that moment leave whatever they were doing and dedicate a few moments to talk with God.

The first day that Martha and Fausto were there, at 4 in the afternoon the song to pray was heard and we told them about this custom. If they happened to have other beliefs different to ours they didn&#8217;t have any problem accompanying us in prayer.

The days passed, the friendship became stronger, and we were able to meet many of their family since they started to come to the institution to be attended to as well. One day, while we were in a therapy, the reminder sounded at 4. We didn&#8217;t say anything, but Martha was attentive. She was the one that said, &#8220;It seems to me that it is prayer time, I was listening to see if today the song would sound so we could pray together.&#8221;

Not all the situations that we have to pass through are easy, but we have the assurance that there is a God that takes care of us and that God is present in our lives.  We also have the great privilege of being able to communicate personally with Him, knowing that if God takes care of the birds, how much more will he take care of you.
