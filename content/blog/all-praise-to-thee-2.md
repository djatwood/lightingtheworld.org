We have a small prayer group that meets in the middle of the week. It is open to anyone who wishes to attend. We have a diverse group, but there is one lady that stood out to me above the rest. Jane was a 62-year old atheist. Although she struggled with her beliefs, she still attended our small group. Suddenly, without notice, she stopped attending our meetings.

Several months past without hearing from her. Interestingly enough, Jane came to church one Sabbath. She told me that she had a lumbar hernia. Unfortunately, her doctors refused to operate on her, due to her diabetes. Upon hearing her news, I invited Jane to come to ACCESS for exercise and treatment.

Our classes always start with a word of prayer and last for 3 hours. Every day, I mention that Jesus has the power to heal people, but only those who believe with all their hearts will receive healing. Jane accepted the truth and decided to believe in the almighty God. A week later, the she felt significantly better.

God has been working on Jane’s heart! In class, we discussed smoking and alcohol. Jane stopped drinking and began to smoke less. For the second week, she was put on a diet that would reduce her sugar levels. In just a few short days of switching to this diet, Jane’s sugar levels decreased by half. This made Jane very happy and she began to pray with us. She also became interested in the Christian lifestyle.

Now, she has ceased to eat meat and junk food. Our mutual friend said that Jane tells everyone about her experience and encourages her friends to commit to a healthy lifestyle.  

 We ask that you continue to pray for Jane, because it is still difficult for her to give up smoking completely.
