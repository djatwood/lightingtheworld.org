It is a wonderful thought that you are keeping Team Thailand in your prayers. The new member of the team turns two months old last Oct 7, he is healthy boy by God&#8217;s grace. Seven months ago since we started the work here in Thailand, we have fallen in love with the mission field though there are big cultural difference and we are handicapped of the dialect, but God teach us to remember this Buddhist country in our prayers. As they were also bought by the blood of the Lamb. 

Thailand ranks no. 3 of the most populated Buddhist country in the world, and so they have 90% of the country&#8217;s total population while Islam has 7% and 3% for Christianity. You can see how minority we are in terms of number here in this country but yet we believe that when we work for God we are always the majority.

We have started out our ministry by selling healthy breads at the market and in that way we have access to meet new people and distribute literature and translated cd&#8217;s of Steps to Christ to the people for free. We have seen some health conscious individuals who are patronizing our product and we begin to make friends with them. As you know that many of the people here does not hear the news of the very soon second appearing of Jesus, and they have not even heard the name and know Jesus in their life. This mission field is really challenging, but one thing is for sure; God will do the work here.

How God is doing the work here in Thailand? LIGHT team were granted the opportunity to give Bible studies once a week to one of our health institution here and 17 individuals were learning about the basic knowledge of the Bible, and yet God again worked it out that we will have twice a week time of doing Bible studies with their Buddhist workers. I am blessed as I see them learning from our study. Last time I made an appeal to them that if they would like to receive a personal Bible they may indicate by approaching the staff, and God worked in their hearts that there were several individuals who ask for a Bible. They have to say it privately as they are shy to show to their fellow Buddhist that they are interested for their own personal study. Please keep them in your prayers.

Another working of The Lord is that last Sabbath we were able to set up a medical missionary branch sabbath school club, these group were composed of nurses from Asia Pacific International University. Starting this Sabbath we are going for an outreach and help the community on their health problems, the young people were very excited of this new endeavor for their school life. Please keep them in your prayers.

The work may be very tiring and challenging on this area, as the medical missionary team here is just mainly composed of my family, and so we are praying for an additional volunteer to come here next year to help with the work. 

Thank you to all of you who are remembering us in your prayers.

The Lord&#8217;s work here have some important needs, please pray for it.

1. Additional medical missionary volunteer at least two, and their financial assistance for their visa.  

2. We need a bigger dough mixer as the order for bread is increasing by God&#8217;s grace, we already canvassed and we saw an item at the price of 18,000 baht.  

3. We will need to buy a Bible for the individuals who request for them to have their own personal Bible at least 10 pieces of them.

Servant for Christ&#8217;s sake,  

Allan Faina
