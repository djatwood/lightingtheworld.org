	The moment God’s will has been starting to be plain for me; it has always been my longing to know Him more. If you’d ask me why, honestly, I don’t know. But for this I’m sure, it’s His love that He faithfully shows me every moment of my life no matter how often I try to carry things on my own. Only by true love is love awakened. –DA, p. 22 

	It was January when Kuya Allan told me that I and three of my co missionaries are assigned to go to Camiguin Island, our mission field for a year. I really have no problem with wherever they would send me, or who will my partners be, etc&#8230; So it goes, we arrived at our mission field. Everything’s well, until this self started to come out -again. My partners’ behavior started to annoy me. I wanted things to be in order, like it used to be in our six months training where time is of an importance, things to be done are settled ahead of time. But even I wanted them to carry out those things which I believe were right; they won’t obey because it wasn’t presented in a loving way. I’m the eldest among the four of us in our assignment and I took it so heavy upon me being their ‘ate’. Everyone around me does not reach my standards. Happiness has left me because of the things that I don’t appreciate. The battle begins –for the nth time. The greatest battle that has ever been fought is the warfare against self. –SC, p. 43 Whenever I remembered to pray, I’d never forget to tell Him to show me my defects, I don’t want to be blind, but I kept closing my eyes and the problem went on for about nine months-yes nine months. It has been that long I have struggled, become hard-headed and hasn’t surrendered. I even wanted to quit thinking that I won’t be an effective missionary because of my behavior. Days are not enjoyable. They pass without leaving something to make me smile. Then my loving God again taught me things I needed to learn that only His love could show:  

1. By looking on the dark side of life, I’d be getting farther and farther from Him. –PP, p. 428  

2. It is by giving that I’d receive.  

3. I cannot change other people, the only thing I can do is to love them.  

4. If I get mad or annoyed at other people, it’s not because they’re misbehaving, but because I don’t see them the way Jesus do.  

5. There are things that I can’t do that’s why I have my partners. I thought I could do things without them, but God has shown me that I cannot, that I have limitations.  

6. I’m not an island. =)  

7. He’s shown me how faith works.  

8. In giving me blessings, He’s testing my character. –CS, 112  

9. He’s always ready to help me no matter how much I make Him feel that I can do things without Him.  

10. I can always find Him and He’s always ready to teach me His will through the Bible and the Spirit of prophecy.  

11. He always gives opportunities. Success depends upon the use made of them. –PP, 223  

12.   Cultivate the habit of speaking well of others. Dwell upon the good qualities of those with whom you associate, and see as little as possible of their errors and failings. When tempted to complain of what someone has said or done, praise something in that person&#8217;s life or character. –MH, p. 492

As my assignment is coming to an end, I could now say that it’s really a blessing to be chosen by Him and be His servant. I now see everyone around me as individuals whom God has chosen to be His instruments to show me how great His love for me is. There’s really no such thing as unlovable person, it’s only this self that paints ugly pictures out of a person whom God chooses to come my way for a reason. The best thing in being His servant? It is discovering his manifestations of Himself, His love, His incomparable glory in ways unexpected and in times perfect. 

The Son of God declared in positive terms that the world was destitute of the knowledge of God; but this knowledge was of the highest value, and it was His own peculiar gift, the inestimable treasure which He brought into the world. –LHU, p. 36
