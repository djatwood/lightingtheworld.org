After the death of her mother and her unsuccessful marriage, Elizabeth was left alone to raise two kids and longed for a better life. Since jobs were scarce, Elizabeth made the decision to start working in a pub in order to support her small family.

By working there, Elizabeth hoped to provide peace and financial stability for herself and her children. Things seemed to be going smoothly when she was able to purchase one large bull and four goats. Despite the fact that the future was looking brighter, Elizabeth still felt a void in her heart. Her life crumbled to pieces soon after she started drinking alcohol. She became a prostitute and fought often with her coworkers .

One of their regular customers, Felix, began taking notice of Elizabeth. Eventually, they moved in together and got married. Life became better and more peaceful. It was at this time that we visited her showed her the promise found in John 14:27. We prayed and invited her to prayer meeting. Before we left, she exclaimed that she already felt a change in her heart. We praised God that she attended prayer meeting that evening. Afterwards, she went home with a “peace that passes all understanding”.










“Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid” John 14:27.










But as usual, the devil was not blind to our work and was not going to leave Elizabeth alone without a fight. A few days after the prayer meeting, her husband was thrown in jail for embezzling money from his boss. Elizabeth made the conscious decision not to be discouraged and started praying many times that day for her husband. God also impressed upon the hearts of our church members to pray for Elizabeth even though they knew nothing about her current situation. The following day, we visited her with our district pastor to share some words of encouragement. She was extremely happy to see us. We started sharing from the Word and prayed together before departing. The next Sabbath, she gave her testimony about how God answered our prayers. She said “Felix was released and had to pay less than what was expected.” After this incident, her faith was strengthened and she knows that there is a God in heaven who answers prayers. She has stopped drinking and asks us to give our petitions before the Lord for Felix, that he may stop drinking and accept Jesus as his Lord and Savior. Since then, Elizabeth has become strong in the Lord, comes to church regularly, and believes in the Word and in prayer. What a mighty God we serve!
