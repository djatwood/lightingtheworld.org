 As the days progress, it seems as though time is moving faster. It also seems that the fulfillment of last day prophetic events are moving much quicker. Praise God, Jesus is coming soon! We have a very short time to accomplish the most important work on this earth, “The heaven appointed-purpose of giving the gospel to the world in this generation is the noblest that can appeal to any human being” (CSA 64.9). With such an army of workers as our youth, rightly trained, might furnish, how soon the message of a crucified, risen, and soon-coming Savior might be carried to the whole world! How soon might the end come… the end of suffering and sorrow and sin! How soon, in place of a possession here, with its blight of sin and pain, our children might receive their inheritance &#8212; (ED 271.2).

A new bible seminary school has opened up in India, hidden in the mountain peaks. Among the classes, medical evangelism is taught to the students as a means to reach people in their local villages and communities. God has sent a recent graduate from another Bible seminary to teach the LIGHT program, at this current location. God also provided a retired ordained minister to teach the Bible classes. Praise the Lord for equipping this school with enough staff to start up this medical evangelism training program.  Continue to pray for this school, the students and the administration. May the Lord be in the center of all they do!
