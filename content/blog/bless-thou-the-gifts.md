*This story is told in the perspective of Joseph, a LIGHT representative in Africa. *











We thank God we are living in exciting times. We are passing through a time of trouble “such as never was”. Our political arena has a new dispensation. The economy is in shambles. Medical missionary work is on the rise through the ministry of L.I.G.H.T.  

We have L.I.G.H.T teams in Mutare, Harare, Mhondoro, Norton, Chegutu, Gweru and Bulawayo. We centralize our trainings to a particular team so our core team attends to the business of the training. We currently have 26 students in Gweru for our Essentials of Health Evangelism Training Course. We thank God for a couple that sponsored the 26 students. A preacher in our local conference, Pastor Nhari, is coordinating the training for the students. This will go a long way in “lighting up” the conferences located in the midlands.

The Mutare team is busy with patients at our sanitarium in Nyanga, which opened 3 months ago. They also have a Health Shop that is thriving in Mutare. They recently had a week of health awareness and a health expo for the public.  

The Harare team has specialized in prison ministry since January. They started with a plan to stop drug abuse. It’s now a full-time project with weekly visits. The team assists prisoners with toiletry, food and clothing. Recently, 89 prisoners have been baptized.  

The Mhondoro team is specializing in food production and training in bee keeping and organic gardening. Our summer crops include rice, maize, pumpkins, sweet potatoes, finger millet and assorted vegetables. We are also starting an herbal garden. Our greatest need is fence, bore, tank and pipes. We are also sourcing food canning equipment.  

The Zimbabwe team also facilitates trainings in neighboring South Africa. We have plans to L.I.G.H.T up Namibia next year God willing.
