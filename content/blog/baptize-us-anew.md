*This story is told by Sebastian Naumann (TGM school leader)











As I was swimming with Erik, who got baptized just recently in the TGM neighbors’ pond, Erik’s neighbor Andreas (age 35), who had attended Erik’s baptism, joined us. He surprised me with deep, spiritual questions that arose because he was so impressed with the baptism, the place and the people there.










*TGM = Trainingzentrum für Gesundheitsmission











Since we’d seen the Holy Spirit working on the heart of Andreas, Erik and I started to pray for him every day by phone. Immediately, Andreas expressed his desire for watching more lectures about current events and prophesy. On Sabbath, he decided to visit an Adventist church service for the first time. Three days later, the Lord answered our request for Andreas to have the desire to confess his sins and surrender his life to Jesus. Andreas gave his life to Jesus, destroying and removing all occult paraphernalia from his apartment that same day. Now we could start with Bible studies.  

One year later, Andreas applied to be a student at TGM. Since he had had many battles, given his past esoteric involvements and training in Shamanic teaching, he experienced precious victories and was a special blessing for many guests that visited TGM having had a similar background. During the school year, Andreas received Bible studies and made the final decision to follow Jesus. It was his deep desire to finish the TGM training with his baptism, which took place just before the student’s graduation. On this occasion, he brought to the amazed listeners a powerful testimony about how he had searched everywhere, only to find help in the natural remedies of God and in Jesus Christ.  

Andreas’ mother and sister attended the baptism and were really touched by his testimony and the dramatic change they witnessed in his life. As a result, his mother and her sister joined one of our NEWSTART sessions a few months later. They thoroughly enjoyed the program, opening up for the spiritual messages and making friends with Adventists from their region. Andreas is currently helping out at home, witnessing to his relatives, digesting all the impressions from the TGM training and praying for the future plans that God has prepared for him.
