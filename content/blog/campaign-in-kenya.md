As told by Pastor Leon Curfs, East Africa Regional Director for LIGHT










We had a blessing to present health and Bible at a campaign conducted from 7th – 20th October 2019, in Migingo near Migori, Kenya in October.  We send our teacher Danvas Morang’a who reports the following:

                    “The messages presented during the campaign touched the hearts of the people and at the end, 23 people gave their lives for Baptism and 27 people joined by profession of faith.  By God’s grace Migingo has now an SDA Sabbath school. The Lord blessed also our daily visitation, we found many people ignorant regarding God’s Word. Most people don’t even have a Bible in their homes.  They are troubled with health, family, and financial issues, but God had sent us to bring help to the people regarding their issues. Every evening people came to listen and you could see each of them very keen interest every word that was spoken regarding Bible study, family life, prophecy, health, and the sermon.”

Here are few testimonies on how the campaign was a blessing to Migingo area:

                    A young man called Philip who is a member of the Pentecostal Assembly of God Church came to the meetings the first 3 days and on day 4 we had an opportunity to speak with him. Philip informed us that he had gone to a PAG Bible school studying to be a pastor.

                    As he listened to the teachings presented daily on Bible study and Health, he realized that what he heard was different than what he was taught at Bible school.  He informed us that “every evening I go home and search the scriptures to see if what you are teaching is true and Biblical”.  After attending for 5 days and comparing what we are teaching with the Bible he was convinced that all our teachings were true and Biblical.  This made Philip stand for the Bible, its truth and its Lord and thus Philip decided to leave the PAG church and was at the end of the campaign baptized and joined the newly planted SDA Sabbath school in Migingo.

                    Maria testified during the campaign that after presenting her prayer request God answered her immediately.  She had a backache and then was told to go for an operation in Nairobi in the same week we were conducting the crusade.  She came to us and told us to pray for her.  Two days later she comes and says “I have been healed.”  We praise God for the answered prayers. She is also among the 27 who vowed to join the new Sabbath school.

                    At the end of the campaign, Pr Ayola, one of the speakers, asked the question if somebody was moved by God to give a piece of land to build a Sabbath school, Marowa immediately raised her hand and said she will give her land, which she did.  It really reminded me on the day when the disciples preached and the hearts of the people were moved and sold even their land and brought the money to the apostles.
