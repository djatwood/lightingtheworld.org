On my way back to the Nepal and Indian border I was praying I would reach in time before immigration closed. As I was traveling in the bus it began to be clear to me that I was not going to make it on time. I prayed to the Lord that he would keep the immigration open just for me to cross at least. After reaching the Nepali immigration office they told me that the Indian immigration had closed and suggested to get hotel and come back in the morning. I made it clear that I planned to cross the border that day and so the officer gave me the departure form to fill. After stamping my passport the officer told me to hurry across the border to the Indian immigration. Another border patrol officer helped my in a rickshaw and I made it to the Indian Immigration well after it was supposed to be closed, but praise the Lord I was able to get through without any problem. I thank God for his guidance.
