*This is told in the perspective of Ron and Carin Lynch, LIGHT’s North American Directors.









2018 was a truly blessed year as we embarked to minister in North America, the birth place of the Seventh-day Adventist movement.

We wondered and prayed at the beginning of the year how God would open doors for us. We planned to actively pursue a huge continent of people, who, many times are too distracted by everyday life to not only minister to others, but to even recognize their own condition.

Amazingly, God came through in a mighty way with a powerful message, “Go ye…”. We were willing, but the Lord needed to make us able.  “Where do we start?”, we wondered. Then, our first church of the year was at the Battle Creek (Dime) Tabernacle. This is located in Battle Creek, Michigan.  We thank the Lord for putting us where He wanted us to be. In 2018, we ministered about our health message in the same place where it began many years ago. There’s no better way to start than at the beginning!
