Here is an encouraging report from Manoah, our West Africa Regional Director:





Last Sabbath we ended the Health Essential training in the first of the 3 venues: SDA Church Laranto Jos.





We are very excited at the great enthusiasm shown by the students, the Conference Secretary preached the sermon in the divine service and did the prayer of consecration and the Union Health director handed the certificates. It was a short and colorful graduation ceremony during the divine service. 36 students were graduated.





The summary is as follows:





    Place: SDA Church Laranto &#8211; Jos


    Dates: May 2 &#8211; September 19, 2015


    Enrollment: 40


    Number Graduated: 36
