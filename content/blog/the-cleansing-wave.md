*This is told in the perspective of Serghei Costash, LIGHT’s European Divisional Director.









One of our church members has a friend named Radu. He was working in the industrial field, with a company that produces dairy products in Moldova. Part of his job was to cook and prepare meals for 70 people every day!

One day, he received an invitation to come to our Essentials of Health Evangelism course. We also had a cooking class that was combined with this training. After Radu tasted our food, he decided that he wanted to continue attending the classes.

After completing the course, Radu was baptized. Praise the Lord! He was convinced, that, if this church was right about the principles of health, they must also be right about the path to eternal life.

His wife noticed that her husband and children were going to church every Sabbath. She was very suspicious of this new religion that was infiltrating her home. Nevertheless, Radu tried his best to convince his wife about the teachings of the Seventh-day Adventist church. 

Through many trials, the Holy Spirit continued to work on the heart of Radu’s wife. She accepted Jesus as her personal Savior and friend. There is no life without Christ. Praise the Lord for His multiple ways to reach the hearts of his people.
