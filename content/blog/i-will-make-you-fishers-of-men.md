I am so grateful to my grandmother who led me to God. Every Sabbath, she would take my younger sister and I to the local church. We have a big, friendly church and this helped me to know Jesus Christ better and accept Him as my personal Savior. At 15 years old, I got baptized. After that, I was feeling how the devil was trying to persuade me to sin more strongly. I had difficulties at school. During university, I frequently experienced reproaches and demeaning jokes from my relatives. Some &#8220;friends&#8221; stopped talking with me, saying &#8220;Why do you need this church thing? When you get older, then you can become a believer, now just live your life.&#8221; These difficulties were nothing compared to what Jesus suffered and sacrificed because of His great love for me. He encouraged and strengthened me the whole way and always blessed me abundantly.

After finishing my studies, I started working in the commercial field, but as the years drew on, I was realizing that this work was not for me. It was connected with risks, and I often had to deceive people in order to earn money, which I knew was not right. Every day, the Holy Spirit urged me through my conscience saying that this is not what I should do and that God has something better for me. 










&#8220;And he saith unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.&#8221;  

Matthew 4:19.










However, I was afraid to change something, I was afraid to lose my job, my salary, and my career. I was praying that God would reveal His will, and He did. In 2013, I decided to visit a medical missionary school. Being impressed by the experiences of missionaries and young people who wanted to serve God, I decided to attend a mission school. After a month long medical- missionary training, I wanted to join this ministry. Unfortunately, I did not have the money to pay for the six month training and at the same time, there was a need to help my parents. So, I decided to go back to my job.

In the spring of 2016, a group of missionaries visited our church with a call to work in various countries around the Middle East. While they were sharing their stories and testimonies, I had already decided to go, and I knew for certain that&#8217;s where He wants me to be, that it is His will for me to become a &#8220;fisher of men&#8221;! Today, as then, His command / appeal for all of us remains unchanged: &#8220;Go and teach!&#8221; Now, I am studying in a medical missionary school in Europe. Praise the Lord for the truths that we are learning here. I pray that I will have opportunities to share my knowledge in the near future.
