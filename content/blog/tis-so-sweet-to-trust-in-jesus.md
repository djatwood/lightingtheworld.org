My reason for coming to the Brazil mission trip stems from my experience during the “Health Talks” class during the 6-month course in Wildwood. I do not like public speaking and I always try to avoid doing so, if possible. When I applied to Wildwood, it was stated that we would be giving presentations. I reasoned that when that time rolled around, I would be able to do it. When the time did come, I thought I could not do it, and I tried my hardest to get out of it. I eventually did the presentations. However, in my opinion, I could have done better. Not necessarily in the content of the slides, but in my approach. I did not put my trust in God and rely on Him to use me. Brazil was my chance to have faith in God and let Him help me overcome this.

When planning the mission trip, it was decided that I would teach Spirit of Prophecy and Hydrotherapy classes. I really wanted to plan everything beforehand by having all my slides ready so that I can have an idea of how I would conduct the classes. This, I believed would help me prepare to do my presentations. However, God showed me that in this way of thinking I was relying too much on myself, and not trusting Him. It turned out that I was not able to plan anything for Hydrotherapy before arriving in Brazil. Although I had prepared my slides for the SOP classes, when I landed, I was told that I would no longer be teaching that class! God was making it so that I had no option but to trust Him. When the day came to do my first class in hydro, I was so nervous. I wanted to simply go over my material and practice that day so that I was prepared for my class. However, that same morning, I had to give two hydrotherapy treatments to some sick students. While I was happy to help, in the back of my head, I was starting to worry that I would not be able to practice! It turns out, when I finished giving those treatments, I only had half an hour before my class would begin. I understood it to mean that God will take care of me, no matter the situation. So I read over my slides once, prayed and then went to go give the class. Thankfully, the class went amazingly! Better than I could have prepared for, and I knew it was God. Every day, God came through and helped us give those classes, and I was truly grateful.

During the same week that I was giving hydro classes, I was told that I needed to teach the “God’s Call for You” classes the following week. I went to check the handbook to see what material I could use for constructing my slides, and there was next to nothing there. So I had to basically start from scratch. Someone from my team offered to help me with some of the classes and I was very thankful. While constructing the classes, I realized God had given me this class because I was trying to understand what God’s will was in my own life at this point in time.

The day of my first class I was so nervous again. Even more so than hydro because it was a spiritual class. Interestingly enough, I had studied 1 Kings 19 recently and I made a connection. After the miracle on Mount Carmel, Elijah cowardly ran away from Jezebel and pleaded to God that he may die. Elijah should have had more faith in God, considering how God used him at Mount Carmel and had kept him safe three years prior from King Ahab and Jezebel. Unfortunately, Elijah lost faith and hid. Similarly in my case, after the evidences I saw of how God had come through for me previously, I was starting to doubt and lose faith. Recognizing my fault in this, I prayed for forgiveness and faith and went to give my class. It was the best class I had given from my whole time in Brazil.










&#8220;Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. 7 And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.&#8221;  

Phillipians 4:6-7.










My whole experience here in Brazil has increased my faith and has opened my eyes to trust myself less and rely more on God.
