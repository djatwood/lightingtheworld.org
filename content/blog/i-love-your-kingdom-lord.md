*This is told in the perspective of Dr. Dosung Kim, the director of Instituto Quebrada Leon in Bolivia.









I have been involved in more 1-month training courses with LIGHT than I can count. Nonetheless, it never ceases to amaze me how well put together the LIGHT program truly is.  I always come to the end of the course amazed at the multitude of blessings from so many people being transformed into health evangelists, in such a short time.  

What I have observed, is that, many of the attendees get the needed physical, mental and spiritual rest they needed from their hectic pace of life back at home. Students receive a training so completely packaged, that many tell us, “Why didn’t anyone teach us this before?” Or “I wish I had known this when I became a Seventh-day Adventist 20 years ago!”  

After many months of planning and preparing for the this year’s LIGHT 1-Month health evangelism training course in January of 2019, the day finally arrived for the students to begin their training. Many students arrived at our school almost 2 hours from the city of Santa Cruz by bus, taxi, plane, foot, or a combination of any or all of the above.  Many come from other countries around South America, as well as Bolivia, where we are based.

Unfortunately, we had to turn away 36 people who pled with us to let them attend. Due to limited space, we had no other option (we are planning to have two one month LIGHT programs at the end of this year, for the first time). The 86 we decided to accept, came with excitement and anticipation of what they would be experiencing during the month long course.  

What we have discovered over the years, is that, even though we call it a health course, what many of the people are wanting is an experience that they have never had before. People want a deeper and a more profound experience, an encounter with their Creator.  As organizers of the course, what we pray for is an experience so profound that it changes their lives for ever.  

Everything we do has this end in mind. From the early morning personal devotional time, meditating on the word of God, prayer, exercise, classes and work.  

At the beginning of His ministry, Jesus called for disciples and said, “Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.  And immediately they left their nets, and followed Him.” Matthew 4:19, 20.  

It is not always necessary to leave our profession to be fishers of men, but we are seeing more and more people of all ages and of all classes of society (this year majority of our students are professionals) responding to the call of Jesus to become fishers of men on a full time basis. Immediately leaving their nets of comfort, financial security, social connections, prestige, and respect from others, because they sense the call of urgency.  They believe that this world can not go on as it has been, for much longer.  Jesus is coming soon, and there is still a lot of work to be done to prepare people to be ready for His soon coming.  

May God bless everyone who is responding to the call to full-time mission work and are being prepared in many of the missionary training schools all over the world through various LIGHT programs.  LIGHT is such a necessary program for these last days of Earth’s history.  What amazing possibilities we have before us, as sinful (but forgiven) and finite beings become one with the Divine, imbued with the power of His Spirit.  The work will be world encompassing and will be finished rapidly.  “&#8230;the final movements will be rapid ones.“ (9T 11.2).  

“We shall see the medical missionary work broadening and deepening at every point of its progress, because of the inflowing of hundreds and thousands of streams, until the whole earth is covered as the waters cover the sea.” MM 317.3.  

Amen! Amen! Amen!
