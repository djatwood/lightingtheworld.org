Our booth gets pretty full in the evenings. As soon as the clock struck 5 pm, the park started to get crowded. I’d noticed that many of the individuals that visited our booth were young people. Yes, we had some older folks that would stop by here and there, but we tended to have a predominantly younger crowd. Many people that came to our booth seemed to have problems with overcoming bad habits.

This is mainly because they’ve been used to bad practices for so long, that it almost seems impossible to break. Thankfully, we know that with God, all things are possible. As we explained the “Longevity Survey” form, many people are shocked to find out their health status’. Fortunately, after taking the survey, many were more than willing to make healthy changes.

During our third day at the booth, we met a variety of people. One man stood out in particular. Not because of his looks or mannerisms, but rather by the conversation that took place. The man had taken one of our surveys. I was eventually able to explain his results that came back from the survey. The more we talked, the more questions he would ask about health. I was able to explain a plethora of topics dealing with the subject. As I told him about the dangers of snacking between meals and its damaging effects on the digestive system, his wife interrupted and said that, &#8220;Some doctors say that it is ok to eat small meals throughout the day&#8221;.  

Before I could utter a word, the man suddenly tapped the hand of his wife and said &#8220;It is wrong&#8221;. At that moment, I knew that he had some type of knowledge of health and/or medicine. As the conversation drew on, we were able to discuss healthful sleeping habits. I described how we ought to be in bed as early as 9 pm for our brain to rest and repair itself (usually occurs 11 pm-1 am). Many of us neglect this important health law. We were even able to talk about the proper food that we should be eating, and the reasons why alcoholic beverages should be avoided. During the whole discussion, I had thought that he was just an ordinary individual who just so happened to walk up to our booth for a health consultation. As we ended our conversation, he asked me if I had studied medicine. I said, &#8220;No, but I&#8217;m a nurse&#8221;. Then he answered saying, &#8220;I am a doctor… thank you I learned a lot from you&#8221;. That came as a surprise to my translator and I. It&#8217;s quite hard to believe that I was talking to a doctor, then I remembered the conversation with his wife from earlier on.

Through this experience, I learned to praise God for the knowledge and wisdom that He continually imparted to me. Alone, I can do nothing. With God’s help and guidance, I can share the health message to other people. I&#8217;m so grateful for this experience. God has shown me time and time again that if we only lean on Him, He will strengthen us to do His will. This experience taught me that a lot of people out there are still looking for the truth. As Seventh-day Adventists, we are so blessed with the knowledge that we have. Let us not hesitate in sharing that message to the world. Let us do the work that God has commissioned us to do. I pray that we may be the salt and light of the world. As a result of your witness, you may bring souls into the Kingdom of Heaven.
