Santiago del Estero is a city of about 300,000 inhabitants, situated in the north of the Republic of Argentina. The population is mostly catholic with strong traditional roots. In this city there are 5 Adventist churches with around 170 members. God put in the heart of the pastor in charge of the district, Christian Cayrus and several of the brethren with the desire to use health as a medium to reach the community, following the inspired counsels of Ellen White. This is how the idea came about to do a healthy life journey of 5 days and after much prayer and effort we were able to concrete the idea. So from Octobre 19-23 the &#8217;60 minutes more life&#8217; journey was put into effect. 200 people were expected to show up, but it was just a group of 80. But God is in control of everything. Human beings measure success based on quantity, but God looks at it based on quality. We prayed that God would send the people necessary to hear the message, and that&#8217;s how he did it.

It was a week full of blessings, and toward the end God gave us many truely motivating experiences. Many people wanted to know more about God. I will only share about one, Beatriz. She sat every day on the last row, but from the beginning she demonstrated her interest in knowing more and she promised to make changes in her habits. Every day she attended, every day she participated, and every day the Holy Spirit worked on her heart. One of the last nights she came to the pastor and told him &#8220;I want to know more about what you teach your church, I want to attend your church&#8221;. And this is how it went. On Sabbath she was present at the Central Church of Santiago del Estero. She was received with affection by the brethren of that church, participated in the Sabbath School lesson and asked for a study guide so she could study the lesson. She also shared with the brethren that she no longer wanted to be a visitor, but that she wanted to attend the adventist church and know more about God. God is great.

If it would have been necessary for Jesus to die for only one person, He would have made the sacrifice willingly because it was worth it, but it wasn&#8217;t just one, there are many who decide to accept salvation. If doing the journey was necessary just so that Beatriz could get to know God, all the effort was worth it. But it wasn&#8217;t just her, there were more stories like hers.

Jesus Said &#8220;I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.&#8221; John 10:10
