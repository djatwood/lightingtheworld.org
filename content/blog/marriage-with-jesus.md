This month we have a special testimony to share. From the beginning of our Women&#8217;s Ministries course we have been planning to have a baptism half way through the course. Most baptisms in India and Nepal that I have seen in other places have been more like a religious &#8220;holy bath&#8221;. It was done so one could go to heaven but not out of a change of heart or a living relationship with Jesus. The men will take off their shirts and others wear their old clothes and others will wear their jewelry and other things that show they are still part of the world. They are dipped in the water but come up the same. Life continues as it always did.










&#8220;&#8230;I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ.&#8221;  

2 Cor. 11:2










But this year as we have been studying the 30 Bible Lessons one of the young ladies asked if she could accept the Lord as her Saviour. There were several others who were secretly desiring to do the same who when they heard of her desire also voiced theirs also. We had a special evening program for them. Then the young ladies started  

to really talk about when there would be a baptism. They wanted  

to be baptized so much. Some had wanted to be baptized for a  

long time.

In Mungpoo we had made some baptismal robes but they were left at the Mungpoo church and were not what we really wanted. This time I was to be gone for a few days before the baptismal program with the two tailoring masters. We were not sure what the advanced students should do during this time. So we had them sew baptismal robes. They turned out very nice.  

The day arrived!  

The young ladies were so excited! Several have families that are not supporting them in this step. One young lady (Saru) when she had accepted Jesus about 1 year ago had a lot of persecution from her home. They told her to not come in the house. But she did not pay attention to their threats.  

She just continued to live a happy, Christian life helping around home. When she came here she did not get her father&#8217;s blessing as he is a drunkard and often under the influence of alcohol. One day she called her mother and told her she is was planning to get baptized. Her mother told her that this was not necessary. When she returned from the course she could still become Hindu again. But Saru said she could not go back.  

It was so special to see the glow on their faces as they raised their hands in acceptance to the baptismal vows. As they were getting ready to be dipped under the water several asked their names to be changed from Hindu or meaningless names to something that shows they are now a follower of Christ.

Roshan and Simon had been studying with four precious souls from up the mountain in Gogani. This church is in a very backward village that earns its money with broom grass and cardamom and then most of the people waste all their money on gambling and drink. We have had several of our Bible workers and interns work there off and on during the last six years or so. This last Sabbath I drove the motorcycle up the mountain to that church for followup with Roshan and Simon. (It was my first time driving on such a long rough road but God gave me strength and He helped me to keep it from falling along the road-even though it was a real work out.)










&#8220;Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that ye should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God.&#8221;  

Rom. 7:4










After church we went to one of the new baptismal candidates homes. Two of them were sharing testimonies that they had known nothing of God or what it meant to be a Christian until our Bible workers came and taught them. Another lady was sharing how she had married a backslidden Christian and when sickness came she started searching for the True Healer. She said she had found Him in Christ. But she knew not what it meant to be a Christian.

Another lady who returned from one of our LIGHT (Bible and Health) courses had shared what it meant to be a Christian. She rejoiced she could learn so much from her. Now several of these new believers want to take our Women&#8217;s Ministries Course in October. Ramesh and his wife from Gogani also were fruits of Simon and Roshan&#8217;s work. The two of them roomed in this couples home. They have been able to teach them to have morning and evening worship, how to eat healthfully, how to keep the Sabbath from Friday sundown to Saturday sundown, many principles from the Bible and so much more.  

Ramesh is now the cornerstone of the church.  

Two weeks before the baptism Roshan and Simon went to a nearby sister church and helped prepare another family as well. They didn&#8217;t have much time there so only the daughter was interested in being baptized now. But now the Roshan and Simon are continuing on with the studies.

As the candidates were beginning to lift their hands for the baptismal vows one of the older men from the area that Gideon had been working in asked if he could also be baptized. His daughter had been preparing for her 10th grade exam and had been staying in Joseph&#8217;s home.  

She was happy to see her father make this step after several years. He had been a witchdoctor before and when his wife who had been sick for a long time got well through the power of God, a former witchdoctor came to him and told of the power of the true God. He gave up his work as a witchdoctor and accepted Jesus, but he just couldn&#8217;t give up tobacco.

Finally, with the help of Jesus, he was able to leave that bad habit. And when he heard that there was going to be a baptismal program in Jante. He quickly made his decision to be among those being baptized.
