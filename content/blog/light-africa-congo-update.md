Here is a list of prayer requests from our team in Congo:

*   Dr Grivas twisted his knee as we were riding in the jungle to a family; we have been doing hydrotherapy and charcoal poultice and now after 3 days he can already walk without his crutches but limping;
*   In our second session (starting Jan. 16) we were supposed to have 40 students and now the Union is sending some 20 more. It is a challenge to teach practical things to such a big group. We need wisdom.
*   little Louis , a student who is having severe spine pain,
*   little Flory
*   for our health;
*   for our revival and reformation (Ez. 37);
*   for our evangelistic series and Health Expo;
*   for the 49 Bible workers and evangelists who will go to their working place starting Jan. 16.
