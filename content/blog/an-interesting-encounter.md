[![April 2016 Interesting encounter 00](http://lightingtheworld.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/April-2016-Interesting-encounter-00.png)](http://lightingtheworld.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/April-2016-Interesting-encounter-00.png)  

Isaac and his wife were with me traveling to Assam in India. I had been asked to hold several breakout seminars at the annual meeting (camp meeting). Train reservations often have to be made weeks to two months in advance. As with us, the invitation came just a week and a half before traveling. The train system has a few tickets reserved for such occasions called tatkal. We left the Center at 6:30 in the morning to try to get to go through immigration, and travel to the rail ticket counter in time to get 3 tatkal tickets.

However, an hour down the road, I realized I had forgotten my passport. I HAD to return. This ended up delaying us past getting tatkal. Our only option was to buy a general ticket (third class with no options to lay down to sleep). Isaac was determined to see if there might be any berths that people had missed. He had us get on a second class car (standing) while he went to find the conductor. We would have to pay a fine, but we might get a place to sleep. The conductor told him there was little chance until Gowahati but he would try.

Some travelers invited us to sit on a berth near the door while we waited. Some of the passengers mentioned that the berth above us hadn&#8217;t been occupied so far, so they began removing their extra luggage so we might be able to get one spot. Just then a young man appeared. It seems he had booked a ticket, then some friends had persuaded him to travel with them and had booked a ticket with them. Now he was interested in selling his first ticket. Isaac was gone, so I asked the price. He said, &#8220;Your choice.&#8221; Then he indicated 500 Indian rupees would be acceptable. Then he changed and offered 700 rupees. I shook my head and he changed to 600. Just then Isaac arrived.










&#8220;Isaac said, &#8220;We eat to live, right? And then what? We all die, right? Then what?&#8221;










Isaac showed me he had gotten the upgrade, but we had to pay a hefty fine, and might not get a seat until Guwahati. Then he began listening in on the conversation. A regular ticket runs around 400 rupees. While we were considering what to do, another man to the side of the crowd that had gathered shook his head. It seemed the owner of the seat was wanting to make money, so Isaac made the decision we would not take the seat. The stranger who shook his head took the initiative to help us find something among his companions. He ended up giving me his upper berth and Isaac&#8217;s wife another upper berth. That was hard to accept, but he insisted.

Isaac&#8217;s wife and I were soon asleep. He and this young man stood in the isle and began chatting. He is a clerk in the army. He makes a handsome salary. And as is often the case, he asked Isaac how much he made. It was not even a fourth of the salary of this young man. He asked Isaac what his incentive was&#8211;was he satisfied with so little?

Isaac asked him if he could ask him a couple questions. He agreed. Isaac asked. Why do you earn (why do you need a big salary)? The fellow looked a bit puzzled. &#8220;What are the options?&#8221;  

Isaac replied, &#8220;Do you earn to eat and enjoy, or to help others?&#8221; &#8220;To eat and enjoy.&#8221;

&#8220;Why do you eat?&#8221;  

&#8220;Why do I eat? Are there options here?&#8221;  

Isaac said, &#8220;We eat to live, right? And then what? We all die, right? Then what?&#8221;  

&#8220;I guess you go to heaven or hell.&#8221; Now this is a Hindu speaking. Hindus usually believe

you change your life through reincarnation.  

&#8220;And how do you get to heaven?&#8221;  

The young man replied, &#8220;By your good works. If your good works exceed your bad

works you go to heaven.&#8221;  

&#8220;How does that happen that good and bad go to heaven? In heaven there is no sin. Let me

give you an example. If your shirt gets a stain, will you get rid of the stain by covering it with a patch the same color of your shirt?&#8221;

&#8220;No it won&#8217;t.&#8221;

&#8220;No, there will not be any sin in heaven.&#8221; Then Isaac explained to him the plan of salvation. He explained how Jesus came to this earth from heaven. How He lived a sinless life and died the death we should die. The young man was thoughtful.

Isaac continued. &#8220;Don&#8217;t the Hindus sacrifice an animal to take away their sins? How can an animal atone for our sins when their life is not as valuable as man&#8217;s life? It would take someone at least as valuable as man to atone for man&#8217;s sin. And it would have to be someone without sin. Is there any one here on this earth who is without sin?&#8221;

The thoughtful young man acknowledged there was none. Isaac explained that only Jesus could. Isaac mentioned that in India, if someone had committed murder and was sentenced to hanging, someone else could take the punishment in his place and the accused could go free. &#8220;That is what Jesus has done for us. And not only has He died in our place, but He will help us daily to live without sin. This has to be a daily work. Like eating daily to live. We need strength from Jesus daily to live without sin. Sin cannot be taken to heaven, so we have to get rid of it now.&#8221;

What the young man will do about our conversation will rest with him. We all can pray for him. He turned to find a place for the night. Isaac and his wife shared the same berth. We are praying that the forgotten passport put us in the path of another candidate for heaven.

In the Blessed Hope,
