*This is told in the perspective of a missionary couple in Kazakhstan*











We believe that by God’s grace all is well with you.  

In July, God blessed us with the birth of our third son, Nathaniel. God blessed abundantly, and we are thankful for your prayers and financial support. The construction for our ministry is currently in progress, and so much has being accomplished.

We are writing to tell you of a wonderful opportunity we have been offered. Winter is coming soon in Kazakhstan and we need to install the external insulation on the health center building and a special plastering to finish the outside construction.  Once this is finished, we can continue working on the tile and paint the walls. Finishing the outside is our urgent need.  

The good news is that the Lord has sent us a donor who is willing to give the ministry $20,00 if other donors will match it. Any donation of any amount will help us double this offer; praise God! This money will go towards finishing all the exterior insulation, plastering, as well as some other details inside the building.
