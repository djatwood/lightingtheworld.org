*This is told in the perspective of Ron and Carin, the North America directors for LIGHT.

The church put out their banner and we prayed for God’s blessing.  Sure enough, people came to support, even without access to the street by car. In the end, 100 souls from the community were blessed by the event.  The church is excited to follow-up with the participants and invite them to cooking classes and other health programs that the church is planning.  Pastor Eduardo Monteiro and his wife, Patty, came to participate, support and encourage us.  This was integral to the success of the expo. The church seems eager to continue the cycle of evangelism in their local community.  God is truly blessing.
