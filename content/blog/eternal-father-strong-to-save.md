*This is told in the perspective of Rodney Bowes, LIGHT’s Southern Asian Divisional Director.










These past few months have been a busy time. During the month of April, the LIGHT graduates from Sandra’s training in Nepal were invited to come together for a revival camp meeting. Our LIGHT team along with a few others from the General Conference was invited to conduct the meeting this year. The training lasted for a week. We traveled in a car up the rocky steep mountains. Just as we were about to arrive on the institution grounds, the car got stuck in a ditch. There are no ledges in these steep rocky mountains and the car was dangerously just a few feet from the edge. We were all praying and in shock to find out we were not in a 4 wheeler this whole time. As we were praying, all the male students and staff from the institution came running up the mountain and pushed the car safely out of the ditch. It was a close call and we praise the Lord for His protection and the angels that surround us in such times of trouble!

During the meetings, people&#8217;s lives were touched as powerful messages were shared to the youth. Some mentioned that they never heard such messages, yet they were so timely and practical for their lives. However, one particular night, one of the staff ladies became demon possessed. Another staff member mentioned that this happens regularly to this particular young lady, especially during such revival meetings. Everyone gathered to pray for her through the event, until the Lord brought her out of it. We continued to pray for her throughout the evening. After that night, she was okay. We know the enemy works hard to discourage us, but we praise the Lord for His already won victory and immeasurable protection and strength over our lives!  

All in all, it was a very successful meeting with a wonderful group of believers gathered together in the name of the Lord! We were invited to come back again next year to share more good news about our wonderful Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ!
