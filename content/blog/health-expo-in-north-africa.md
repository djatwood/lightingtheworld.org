The first week together with the local church members we organized a Health Expo program on one of the main streets of the capital city. As the program was held outside we had many visitors. Some of the people were suspicious but most of them enjoyed the program and even started coming every evening just to say hi and to talk to us. One evening, a doctor from a neighboring country came with his family and participated in the program. They were very satisfied with what they saw, so much so that they asked if it would be possible to have the same program in one of their cities. He told us that will solve all the issues with visas and other needs. Now we are looking forward to doing the same program in his country as well.  

One of the great blessings we received was to have ADRA volunteers helping us which are Muslims. In the evenings we had meetings in the church about the roll of the Spirit of Prophesy. We think that we reached our goal because now the church in this city are ready to do Health Expo programs without needing our help. Now we are praying about having a permanent LIGHT worker in this muslim country who would help in organizing other programs around the country.
