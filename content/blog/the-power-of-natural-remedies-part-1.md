This is Cliff Momanyi, a student who gives a testimony on what the Lord has done to his health since he joined LIGHT. He says that he needs to change his wardrobe because most of his outfits are now too big to him.

“I have been having hypertension since 2017. I started treatment in March 2018 when I went to see a doctor. He told me the situation was serious and I had to be on medication. My weight then was very high at 113 kilos. I went to a church lady that treats using herbal concoction but my doctor warned me against using concoctions as they can damage key organs. By this time, I was 106 kg, thanks to the herbs. I met Pastor Leon and his wife during camp meeting in 2019 and started using simple remedies and lifestyle change. As I am writing my weight has reduced to 89kg. I am still fighting high blood pressure, but now, mostly with simple remedies. The medical missionary course had opened avenues for me to learn so many things. From Christian living, nutrition, hydrotherapy, basic nursing, massage, simple remedies, common disease, bible study, knowing God&#8217;s will, the Christian home, and many other topics. I am thankful to God for LIGHT and looking forward to full recovery.”
