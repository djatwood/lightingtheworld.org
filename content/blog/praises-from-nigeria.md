&#8220;I am grateful to God for this opportunity He granted me to be part of LIGHT medical missionary training. I am blessed and  revived with new zeal to work for God&#8230;  As I was receiving the lectures, I shared my daily experience with my family. My husband, who is a literature evangelist and who for sometime now abandoned the work for some other businesses that may give him more money, became excited and decided to read through the Spirit of prophesy series once again. He started with the great controversy and after a few days decided to take up his God-called work of literature evangelism. And God is already opening the ways for him. Praise God.&#8221;
