By Tapiwa Marawanyika, Education Director, Wildwood Center for Health Evangelism










Following an invitation from the Director of LIGHT in South East Asia to send a team from the Wildwood Center For Health Evangelism to conduct a 21-day health training aimed at an underprivileged community as well as for the local church members, we found ourselves headed to Dhaka, Bangladesh in early January.

Bangladesh is situated in the famous 10-40 window and happens to be one of the poorest countries in the world. It has an estimated population of about 170 million people with a religious demographic of 90% Islam, 9% Hindu and 1% other religions (Buddhism, Christianity, etc). Of that percentage, Christianity composes only 0.3%, and Seventh-day Adventists only 0.0003% (33,575 people).

Upon arriving in Bangladesh, we were hosted by the Society for Lowest Urban Mass (SLUM). SLUM operates two schools for underprivileged children from the local slum near where the school is located. Manik Chitto, the director of the school, has a burden to educate the children in the principles of health at their young age. He also desires to help the school’s staff (all of which are non-Adventist) with their health needs, help the families of the children and ultimately impact the entire local community.

We often hear that the health message is the right arm of the gospel meant to break down prejudice and barriers. I find it rare, however, that this statement is implemented in ways that we can witness it effectively, but I believe we witnessed this rare happening in Bangladesh.

One of the most important things we did was engage in teaching the children and teachers and seeing how it unlocked the homes of the children and paved the way for parents to be willing to come and experience the free health counseling and classes. When we had a health day, those who came were people we already taught, yet they brought their neighbors, friends, and family!

The effect of this work was far-reaching. It brought a good report to the church leaders, and we had the privilege of having the Union Mission President, Dr. Lee, and his wife join us on the final weekend we were there. As a result, the church leadership is now eager to see a partnership develop. This may allow us to possibly return every year to teach the church and community members more about the principles of health. After seeing the results of our first trip, I am excited about future collaborations.

Overall, our time in Bangladesh was a mighty blessing. Many seeds were planted, and we learned many lessons from the poor, yet happy people of Bangladesh. The work here is in its infancy, yet there are so many open doors. Please pray for the work in Bangladesh and for those whom we have been able to reach. The right arm lives on.
