I want to praise the Lord for the opportunity to come here to help. He has chosen me to work for Him. I work in the kitchen guiding the students. While I was working with the young ladies in Asia, I had a very different experience. Working with the seminary students has been a challenge. At first it was very difficult working with them. Many of them did not know how to work. God gave me patience to work with them and slowly teach them. It was hard to control myself but God gave me strength. They would work so slow I ended up having to do much of it myself. Slowly they have been making improvements so the burden is not so heavy on me. One day as I was closing up the kitchen, two of the students who had been addicted to tobacco had slipped behind the toilet to smoke. I smelled the smoke and went to check on them. They quickly hid it. But I smelled the smoke on one of their hands. They refused that they had done it. I told a couple of the teachers. Then, administration confronted them the next day. Finally, they confessed to what they did. They were grounded for a week and warned sternly. At first they were angry with me, but then they repented and asked for forgiveness. Since this situation, they have not used tobacco. Praise the Lord.

After some time had passed, we were walking to church one Sabbath. Ronald shared with me his testimony of drugs and tobacco abuse and how he had been in and out of drug rehabilitation centers and jail. He said how he was beaten so hard in that center, but here it was like heaven. He described how when he first came, he would go during study hall to the market to buy cigarettes with his friend. However, since I told administration about his problem, he now feels free from tobacco. He thanked me for my help. One of our students comes from the mountains of Asia. He is very young and immature. At first when he came here he would speak rudely and even retort harshly when corrected. He did not respect me when I tried to guide him in the kitchen. I did not want to work with him anymore. So, I asked Miss Sandra what to do. She counseled me to take him aside and pray and share what God&#8217;s words says about &#8216;speaking&#8217; with him. I prayed and followed her counsel. He listened quietly. After that I saw a gradual change. He became more respectful and humble. In this recent baptism, he also gave his heart to the Lord and wanted to begin anew. He humbly asked forgiveness of me. He understood much better what it means to be a Christian and he wanted to leave his life of roaming with the local boys and living just for selfish pleasure. He is not perfect but God is doing a good work in his life. It is a privilege to be able to work in the kitchen and see how God is working and using me to help lead these young people to heaven.
