Before graduation, I decided to spend a few months with the students as they were coming to the end of their training. The curriculum that we teach from has had a great influence on the students. They are learning things that they can use in a practical way, in their spiritual walk with the Lord. One day, two of the students had a misunderstanding over something small. Later in the evening, two others had another argument. Being that we are a part of the administrative staff, my friend and I talked with the students so that they may understand how to deal with the problem in a Christian way. They listened to us.

The next morning during worship, there was a beautiful thought shared about true repentance. One of the older men in our class was touched by the message. He stood up at the end of worship time to make things right. One by one, the other three who had been involved in the verbal altercation also stood up. Their repentance was heartfelt. There were tears and confession. My heart was touched also. I could feel God&#8217;s presence near in this work of transformation. During graduation, the students shared a lot about their past life. They discussed some of their darkest moments where hope seemed lost. Some of them had grown up in a Christian home, but they did not fully understand the purpose of their life. However, when they received their training here, they felt that God had given them meaning and purpose. All of them have promised to share what they have learned when they go home. As they depart to their respective homes, we pray that these students will not only share their newly acquired knowledge, but that they will share the beautiful love of Christ as well.
