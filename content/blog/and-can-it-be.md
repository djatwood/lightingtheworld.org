Abraham has the most beautiful singing voice. He sings with such deep passion and conviction that one could easily see that he must have a moving and meaningful story to tell about how his life was changed by the LORD. Abraham’s family was Baptist and he had been raised as a Christian but was not following Biblical truths. He was a drunkard and yet was still attending his family’s church and they asked Samuel and Ron to visit him. Samuel met with Abraham and became friends with him. Samuel first talked to him about health and even visited Abraham’s Baptist church one Sunday. Samuel did not miss any opportunities to reach others and took Ellen White books with him, which he distributed that Sunday amongst the Baptist church members. He told them he was a Seventh-day Adventist and shared with them about the Sabbath. Abraham soon began to visit Samuels’ home and eat with him. When Samuel taught Abraham about the Sabbath, Abraham said he was already knowledgeable about it.

Abraham’s way of thinking was challenged when Samuel asked him why he didn’t keep the Sabbath if he knew and believed it to be true. Samuel began to study the bible with Abraham and invited him to church on Sabbath. Samuel also told him about the seminary and that he could attend if he wanted to learn more about the Bible and salvation through Jesus Christ. Abraham took some time to think about this. Finally, the time came for a decision. Early one morning, Samuel went to Abraham’s house and told him that the last chance to go to seminary had arrived. Samuel told him that if he kept drinking, maybe his life would be finished. Abraham agreed to go after consulting with his parents. His parents supported his decision even though it was a Seventh-day Adventist school. They were concerned about travel expenses and school costs but Samuel assured them that the LORD has ways to provide for their every need. Abraham continued studying with Samuel and Ron and was baptized before coming to take a training program with LIGHT. He also plans to attend a seminary program! Abraham can now praise the LORD in beautiful ways with his voice because the LORD has changed his heart and life.
