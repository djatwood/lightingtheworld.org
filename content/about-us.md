## History
The beginnings of LIGHT came with a desire to see more lay members around the world actively sharing the wonderful message of health and salvation.

With the understanding that many will work if they are only taught how to begin, we knew the greatest need was to make short training courses available to everyone. In 2005 two experimental training programs were field-tested in a Western European and a Central Asian country to see what would result. The success of these programs encouraged us to organize LIGHT to better facilitate the global expansion of medical missionary work. Through the help of various ministry leaders in Outpost Centers International, ASI, and Wildwood Lifestyle Center, LIGHT was developed.

In 2008 ASI, under the General Conference of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, accepted LIGHT as an official member organization. Since that time LIGHT has trained over 15,000 church members in over 80 different countries. 

Our vision is to see a global movement of God’s people sharing the light of His love through ministering to the needs of humanity.
