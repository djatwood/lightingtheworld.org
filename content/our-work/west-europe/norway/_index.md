## Overview

In 1986, pastor and educator Gunnar Gustavsen and young theology student Kenneth Jørgensen took their vision of Bible study, mission and young people, and formed the beginnings of Matteson Mission School.

From the sporadic courses and mission projects held in local churches, it developed into a well-organized school. The family atmosphere at Matteson is reflected and underscored by the home-like, permanent facilities in Mysen, Norway, which the Granheim Foundation has provided since 1991.

Matteson Mission School takes 12 students for the one-year program and organizes several big events per year, where large groups of youth are gathered together for inspiring programs. Granheim Foundation is a member of OCI and ASI and the school has been LIGHT accredited since 2011.

## What we are doing

Matteson Mission School includes the six-month LIGHT course with a focus on Bible, Evangelism, Leadership, Health and Agriculture. The emphasis is on a balance between theory and practice, classroom and manual work. A mission trip from January to March gives the opportunity to join other ministries in South and Central America and gain precious experiences.

The purpose of the school is to train and qualify people to become full-time missionaries and choose a life of surrender to God and active soul winning. The goal is that graduates shall become resources for existing ministries or instrumental in starting new ones to prepare a people for Christ´s imminent return.

## Get Involved

**Prayer requests**: Please pray for the staff and students, that each one can follow Jesus’ example and be a medical missionary for life. Pray also for more training centers and lifestyle centers in Scandinavia.

**Financial needs**: Support one of our worthy students with $350/month for their room and board.

**Training opportunities**: 11-month medical missionary training program.
