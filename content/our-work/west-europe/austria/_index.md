## Overview

The Trainingzentrum für Gesundheitsmission (TGM) started in 2006.  A dedicated team of Austrians in connection with LIGHT and OCI wanted to open a lifestyle center and school but God did not seem to answer their prayers for a location. Instead they were led to rent a place in Germany. In faith they began their first school year, going forward with the assurance that the school’s existence was God’s will.

Two years later God answered their prayers and in July 2008, they signed the sales agreement and received the keys to a beautiful hotel in Carinthia, Austria. God’s perfect timing enabled them to purchase the property well below cost. Nestled in a little forest clearing at the end of a road surrounded by farms, lakes and mountains the new location enabled them to continue the medical missionary training school. With the buildings ample guest rooms, suites, beautiful wood trimmed dining room and commercial kitchen it also had enough space for them to make plans for a lifestyle center.

The Country Life team was thankful for the opportunity to see their prayers answered, and they went straight to work. By the first of September, they were ready to start the new school year with students from Austria, Germany, and Switzerland. In the summer of 2011 the little team moved forward by faith and began making plans to open the health center. In March of 2012 the first guests arrived and by the end of the year ninty-one guests had come through the lifestyle programs. God continues to bless and provide for the team in so many ways. They feel that God has truly written the story of TGM, and they long to encourage those they meet to let Him write their story, as well.

## What We’re Doing

TGM is a 12 month health evangelism training and apprenticeship program based on the LIGHT curriculum. The course begins every September and includes, 500+ hours of classroom training, eleven lifestyle sessions, gardening and cooking experience, one-month foreign mission experience and local evangelism experience.  We want to keep the training as practical as possible so our students have the privilege to see themselves as junior team members during their course of training.  Because of the size of the school a strong spiritual and family atmosphere is maintained and the students are able to work along side of the staff in operating the ministry. All have the privilege of sharing in the daily duties that keep everything running smooth. There is a close student to staff ratio, which increases the learning potential, and benefits to the student. In additional to the solid biblical and up-to-date health classes, there is also a strong work program. These work times include working in the garden, the health food store, helping in the office, canning, preparation for the lifestyle sessions or community events, cooking or baking, and outreach in the community.  During the lifestyle sessions the students will help in the kitchen preparing guest meals, assisting with the workshops, exercise programs, treatments, preparation of teas and poultices, and assisting our lifestyle counselors.  Community outreach includes door-to-door visitation, health expos, preparation and presentation of health talks, health clubs, cooking schools, in-house medical missionary work and practical neighborhood help. Students will also be involved in the local church during their course. At the end of the training there are opportunities for advanced training or placement in one of our sister medical missionary institutions. The world is an open door for a lifetime of service.  TGM wants to send as many well-trained missionaries into the world as possible.
