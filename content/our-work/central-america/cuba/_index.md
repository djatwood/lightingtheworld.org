World Youth Group (WYG) was started by two dedicated Volunteers, Henry and Arleen Stubbs. For many years they have been organizing various activities in different towns across the country. After about a decade of hard work, they decided to partner with LIGHT in conducting training courses as well. Since then, God has been opening doors for them to continue to expand their ministry and provide even better training through the establishment of a permanent training location.

## What World Youth Group has been doing

WYG has been doing programs since 2009 partnering with LIGHT to provide the training manuals and other materials. Since then, they have held a LIGHT course every year. They have even had the opportunity to do a training for Physicians just this year (2016)! More recently, they have been making preparations for a permanent 6 month school which they hope to launch within a year and have the ability to prepare many more people including seminary students from a nearby university. As of the beginning of 2016, WYG has been able to train 389 medical missionaries on this island, with plans to train many more!
