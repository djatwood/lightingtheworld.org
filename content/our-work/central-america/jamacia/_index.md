## Overview

LIGHT was blessed to participate in one-week intensive health evangelism training programs across the island of Jamaica from April-May of 2011, by the invitation of Pr. Dudley Hosin, publishing director for the Jamaica Union Conference of Seventh-day Adventists, as well as the local health ministries directors of 4 of the local Conferences on the island. Trainings for literature evangelists and local churches were also conducted. It is inspiring to see the enthusiasm and eagerness that many Jamaicans have to improve their health and that of their families, churches, and communities.

### What Has Happened Since the Training

A number of the individuals involved in the programs have contacted LIGHT, stating that their blood pressure levels have dropped, blood sugar levels have normalized, and weight has improved significantly!  In addition, updates have come in from participants sharing how they were inspired and have been endeavoring to share God’s love with their communities and neighborhoods through the medium of health evangelism—with good results!

## Get Involved

Prayer requests – pray for each of the individuals who completed the classes, that they may graciously share God’s love through the medium of health with each person they have the opportunity to come in contact with.
