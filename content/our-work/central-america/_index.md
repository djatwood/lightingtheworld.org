The work in Latin America is booming! The Inter-American Division of the Seventh-day Adventist church has the largest membership in the world wide church, and for a good reason.

The church throughout this division is focused on developing local church leadership thus enabling the pastor to lead out in more evangelism. More than this, they focus on small group evangelism that builds relationship which culminate in eternal decisions for Jesus. But there is a large class of people that are not reached even through these patently successful methods. This group feels needs for many things which average models of evangelism don’t overtly succor. This group, while turning down an invitation for a Bible Study, would gladly accept an invitation to a cooking school or  health program.

Let’s see how the work of health evangelism works to reach the unreached throughout Central America.
