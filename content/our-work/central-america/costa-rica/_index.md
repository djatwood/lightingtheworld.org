## Overview

The Clare family were dedicated to work for the Lord by Uchee Pines Institute in December 2010.  They then met with LIGHT to understand how to work together teaching the one Month and the six Month schools when in Costa Rica.  April 5, 2011 they arrived in Costa Rica to meet with President Jose Maria Vallejo to plan for health evangelism work in Costa Rica.  With 45 lbs. of charcoal and the Lord on their side they have been able to work for the Lord, preparing people to serve Him.  LIGHT has conducted four One Month Schools and over 100 students have been trained.  Many weekend programs to recruit students for the schools, 30+ cooking schools, massage classes, hydrotherapy training and more than 100 presentations since their arrival have laid the groundwork for the development of a treatment room in Costa Rica to help people practically.  Many Hospitals, schools and Government offices received health and gospel literature.  Other efforts are being done in other neighboring countries of the South Central American Union including Nicaragua and Panama.

## What We’re Doing

An Organization with the name “P.A.T.M.O.S, Output Centers for missionay Talent and Optimum Health” is in the process of being formed. LIGHT and P.A.T.M.O.S will continue to teach and organize health evangelism outreach; they intend to start a 6 month school in 2014 if the Lord so permits.  We wish to establish a College of Health and Evangelism with a Lifestyle Center, and various small industries for the students and the Ministry to become self-supporting.  Efforts will continue to be made through the neighboring countries and the rest of Central America as a team with LIGHT.

Over 7000 lbs. of books and magazines for outreach and evangelism have been brought to Costa Rica.  Efforts to educate regarding Health foods and healthy cooking have started the import of healthy Adventist products to encourage the small industry development. We have started a Zero Cholesterol product development including products such as butter, cheese, mayonnaise and others.

## Our Needs

Our schools in Costa Rica cost $100 dollars per person for the one month schools, if you would like to sponsor students for the upcoming schools this year, this would make it possible for many others to attend the training. This covers the course materials and other class expenses.

Our immediate need is to develop a treatment room for training in hydrotherapy and massage. $30,000 will provide for the materials and equipment to remodel an existing structure in the City of San Jose, Costa Rica.

We need a location to begin the six-month school of health and evangelism in collaboration with LIGHT, with a minimum of 25 acres outside the city.  We plan to grow vegetables, create small industries related to healthful food, and train missionaries to be able to support themselves financially supported.  We plan to provide training to the people who are willing to work for the sick, and become medical missionaries.
