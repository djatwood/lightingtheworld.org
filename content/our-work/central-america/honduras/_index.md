## Overview

Honduras is a very religious and traditionally Catholic country which, however, has an active evangelical Christian community. Hondurans are generally a peace-loving, family-oriented people who work hard to make ends meet in a society struggling with the fair distribution of wealth. Unfortunately this challenge has created an environment where women often are left at home with the children and men resort to finding work in other countries to support their families, which is especially the case in more rural communities. In spite of this, they still press on in faith that God will see them through. LIGHT has held many events, one of which was the catalyst for the opening of a medical missionary training program in 2009. Since then, LIGHT has held courses in Tegucigalpa, Tela and Roatán on a few occasions. This has increased awareness among the church members of their calling to be medical missionaries.

## What We Are Doing

The Instituto Bíblico Centroamericano (IBC) began off the fruits of a one-month LIGHT course held back in 2008. IBC has since become a LIGHT-affiliated 10-month training program. Students not only from Honduras, but also from other countries come to receive further training due to LIGHT courses they received.
