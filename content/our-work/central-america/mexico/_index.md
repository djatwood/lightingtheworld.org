## Overview

Over the past years, LIGHT has had the privilege to conduct a number of one-month health evangelism training programs across the country of Mexico.  On a more permanent level, LIGHT has affiliated with Centro Misionero de Salud (CMS) to help provide materials for their 6 month health evangelism training course in Spanish.

## What We’re Doing

CMS has been in operation since 1995, with a focus on evangelism, health, and education.  This ministry is located out in the country in the Sierra Madre mountains on nearly 50 acres. The ministry conducts lifestyle programs for guests that come from across Mexico and the United states, where guests seek restoration of their health through a healthy diet, exercise, rational natural treatments, and other lifestyle modifications. The institution also has a vegetarian restaurant, health food store, bakery, and offers natural treatments and books for sale in a nearby town, as well as doing radio and Television programs. A 6 month affiliate LIGHT health evangelism training program is also offered, seeking to prepare health evangelists to share Christ’s love across the country of Mexico. A special focus in their training is how individuals can effectively establish their own ministries to help hasten the Lord’s coming.
