## Overview

For more than 15 years, Seventh-day Adventist lay-workers have faithfully endeavored to operate a small supporting ministry in Dominican Republic, called Country Life Institute (also known as Liga de Servicio Cristiano). In earlier years, the ministry had a vibrant educational program out in the country, as well as an active agriculture program, community evangelism outreach, and a restaurant in the capital city, Santo Domingo. During the past few years, however, the team relocated to Santo Domingo and the property in the country and school were left vacant.

At a recent board meeting, the decision was made to reopen the medical missionary training program as a LIGHT health evangelism school. The local conference president also invited LIGHT to conduct three one-month training sessions between January and April 2013 near large cities in the Dominican Republic. These training sessions will be aimed at educating church members, as well as raising awareness and creating an interest in medical missionary work across the country.
What is Happening Now

Since the board meeting in June, a capable and dedicated team has arrived, and restoration of the campus is underway, with a goal of restoring the beautiful campus and preparing it for a permanent training program, beginning in May of 2013. Plans are also being made to open a wellness program a year later.
