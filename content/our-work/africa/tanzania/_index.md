## Overview

In 2008 Rodney and Julie Bowes were invited by the Mara Conference in Musoma to conduct a one-month medical missionary program for 37 lay evangelists.  The program was well received and since that time the LORD has opened the way for medical missionary work to spread throughout the country.

## What We Are Doing

LIGHT has been invited back to Tanzania several times to work with Mara conference and then in 2011 to work with Kibidula Family Development International.  Kibidula empowers over 30 full-time lay evangelists to share the gospel of Jesus Christ throughout Tanzania – from the streets of Dar es Salaam to the Masai Mara.  Through God’s blessing 216 people accepted Jesus as their personal Savior in 2010 through the work of these dedicated lay missionaries.  In 2012 the Schoch family moved to Tanzania to help incorporate more medical missionary work into Kibidula’s vibrant program.

## Recent Activity

During the year 2015 the work has been exploding. There have been 14 students that have completed the one month medical missionary training, 27 lay missionaries in the field, conducted 12 public meetings, over 300 Bibles distributed, 12 churches organized, amongst other evangelistic and training activities primarily organized by Kibidula. That’s not even mentioning the students currently taking classes and the translation work being done!
