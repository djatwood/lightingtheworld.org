AIDS. Malaria. Tuberculosis. These words strike fear in the hearts of the countless millions living on the African continent and rightly so. Africa is known statistically for having the 13 percent of the world’s population with 24 percent of the global burden of disease. Sixty-seven percent of people living with HIV worldwide reside in Africa and 75 percent of annual global deaths from AIDS occur in Africa alone.

But more startling than this is the rapid increase in noncommunicable diseases, including diabetes, hypertension, cancer, and chronic respiratory conditions. Diabetes cases in Africa were estimated at 10 million, a figure expected to rise to almost 20 million by 2025.

Something must be done.

Ellen White writes,”The world is a lazar house filled with victims of both physical and spiritual disease. Everywhere people are perishing for lack of a knowledge of the truths that have been committed to us. The members of the church are in need of an awakening, that they may realize their responsibility to impart these truths.”

Africa needs Medical Missionary Work.
