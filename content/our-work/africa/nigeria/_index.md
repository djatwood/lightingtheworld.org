## Overview

In June of 2011, Rodney Bowes visited Nigeria to explore the possibilities of expanding LIGHT’s influence into Western Africa.  He was amazed to see how the Lord was already putting together a dedicated team of lay members to establish permanent centers of health and healing for the entire region, especially in Nigeria.

## What We Are Doing

Since that time our team has been very busy working with churches (both large and small) in all of the conferences in the country:

* Five one-month trainings have been conducted: two in the North and three in the East with a total 79 Medical Missionaries Trained
* Eight three-week trainings were conducted; Five in the North, Two in the East and One in the West with a total of 161 trained
* Two six-month trainings have been conducted in the East with the total of 13 trained
* As of October 2015 over 250 people have completed one of our training courses and many are actively sharing the good news with their communities

Our Goal in 2016 is to establish trainings in Ghana and Cameroon
