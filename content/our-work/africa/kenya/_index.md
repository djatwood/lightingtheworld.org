## Overview

In 2001 the College of Health Evangelism began conducting short medical missionary training courses in Kenya. Over the next 6 years more than 1000 people received an introduction to this important work. In 2008 LIGHT saw the need for a more thorough training for those interested and was overjoyed when Leon & Irene Curfs, experienced medical missionaries, agreed to lead a new initiative to establish medical missionary schools throughout East Africa, beginning in Kenya.
## What We Are Doing

Since 2009 nine certificate and seven diploma trainings courses have been conducted throughout the country and at our Medical Missionary School at Ogwehdi-Maasai. Training courses have also been conducted in Tanzania, Sudan, Uganda, and Ethiopia. Our Certificates and Diplomas are Government recognized. Hundreds have been trained through these courses and are now laboring in communities and churches throughout Kenya.

We completed our permanent medical missionary school in 2013 at Ogwedhi-Maasai, and started immediately conducting certificate and diploma courses there.

Our trainings integrate class as well as field training. Students participate and conduct programs in our Church. They go out into the community to offer Bible and health studies. They also give cooking demonstrations at churches and people’s homes. They furthermore participate in our “New Life Habits Training Center” were people who are suffering from lifestyle related diseases come and spend a period of 1 – 3 weeks to learn new life habits through hands-on education and lectures resulting in great success regarding these diseases. Students are also involved in our agriculture program. This all is not without results as some students and community members get baptized during and after these trainings.

On 10th October 2010 LIGHT was inaugurated by the Kenya SDA Union as a recognized supporting Ministry and was empowered to conduct Health seminars nationwide a task we have taken very seriously by even trying to impact the Maasai Community.

In 2015 we started to offer Medical Missionary Trainings through correspondence learning as many people are working and can’t come receive classroom training.
