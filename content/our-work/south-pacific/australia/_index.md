## Overview

LIGHT first visited Australia in 2008 when our president James Hartley joined forces with Rod Bailey and Eastward Missionary College to conduct the first LIGHT one-month course in Australia. Both LIGHT and Eastward College share a similar vision for medical missionary work and thus formed an affiliation. Eastward is the only LIGHT school in Australia to the moment, but we are praying for this work to expand due to the great need of missionaries throughout the south pacific and around the world

## Eastward Missionary College

Located in the beautiful Wilson River Valley on the mid-north coast of New South Wales, Australia, Eastward follows God’s original design for education as nature serves as our classroom. Surrounded by rainforest, rolling pastures, rocky rivers, and steep mountains, Eastward is distanced from the turmoil of modern life yet close enough to the people who need to hear the great news of salvation.

Eastward began training in 2004 and provides mission and life skills training that prepares the student for work, family, service, and eternity. The classroom instruction, practical training, physical labor, community outreach, and challenging experiences all work together to develop a heart of love and a symmetrical Christlike character. The team members desire to be practical, vibrant, and happy Christians dedicated to the service of God and the well-being of their fellow human beings.

The courses of study are designed to provide speedy preparation for sharing the gospel, because time is short. Proud to be working with LIGHT, Eastward offers the one-month Introduction to Health Evangelism and follows it up with a nine month Health & Bible Worker Certificate. Shorter seminars and a nationally recognized Certificate IV in Presenting Community Health Education Programs are also offered.

By God’s grace and providence, Eastward is currently developing their beautiful 273 acres of Australian farmland and bush. They already have a small mixed orchard and vegetable garden. The Eastward staff and student family are working together with God to build up a college and a community of believers that will bring Him glory.
