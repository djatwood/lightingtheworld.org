The South Pacific is a region full of contrasts. Some countries are continental land masses while others are dispersed coral atolls. Some have negative population growth rates and/or rapidly aging populations,while others have high fertility rates. Urbanization is occurring in most countries, although several are still predominantly rural. This region includes some of the highest per capita incomes in the world, but some of the countries in the region are still in the low-income category.

Health outcomes vary widely, with some countries enjoying the world’s longest life expectancies and thus ageing populations, while others have high rates of maternal and child mortality and relatively low life expectancy. Noncommunicable diseases are the largest part of disease burden, with 40% of the population diagnosed with a noncommunicable disease.

The South Pacific needs lifestyle education. The South Pacific needs medical missionary work.
