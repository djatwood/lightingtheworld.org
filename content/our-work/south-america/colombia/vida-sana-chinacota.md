Is located in the touristic region of Colombia, has a delightful climate, and has been in operation since 1985. Every year since then this institution has been training missionaries in 3 and 6-month health evangelism courses, which have supported and contributed to the development of other supporting ministries of the Seventh-day Adventist Church across Colombia and Latin America.   Nuevo Amanecer affiliated with LIGHT in 2012, to help further strengthen and develop their health evangelism training and to become more effective in evangelism and in sending missionaries around the world to help hasten God’s work.  Nuevo Amanecer is actively involved year-round in health expos, evangelistic campaigns, and children’s evangelism. This ministry also operates an active lifestyle center which has brought health to many people, as well as a saving knowledge of Jesus.
