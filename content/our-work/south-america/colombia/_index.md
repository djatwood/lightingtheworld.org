## Overview

Over the past 30 years, many individuals have sacrificed deeply and labored faithfully for the Lord across the country of Colombia in the area of health evangelism.  LIGHT has had the privilege in 2012 of affiliating with 3 of these vibrant, permanent health evangelism training institutions—where their Spanish courses in health evangelism range from 3-9 months. In addition, plans are already made to conduct one-month health evangelism schools across the country from San Andres Island in the north, to Cartagena and Sincelejo on the coast, to the city of Bogota in 2013.
