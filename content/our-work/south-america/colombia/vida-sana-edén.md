The Foundation, Vida Sana Edén, was formed 18 years ago to prepare workers for the Lord and for their communities through evangelism and health training.  Many students have been educated over the years.  This ministry operates a wellness center, offering massage, hydrotherapy, mud therapy, nutritional and lifestyle counseling in a pleasant environment out in nature.

The institution also has a health evangelism training program-in affiliation with LIGHT, which offers their students many practical opportunities to develop skills in the areas of nutrition, hydrotherapy, massage, herbal medicine, healthy cooking, agriculture, and evangelism.  The students go out into the communities offering health programs, home visits, and are involved in the local church’s evangelism program.

For self-support, the institution has developed a small business to produce health food products. They are also hoping to develop a second industry which would include the cultivation of sugar cane and production of natural cane products.
