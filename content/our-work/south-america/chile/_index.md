Chile is a land of beauty and contrasts, of fertile orchards, high mountains, dry deserts, and glaciers. Over the recent past God has grown the work of Health Evangelism tremendously, from weekend retreats and day-long seminars, to the first one-month LIGHT course in 2014 in Los Aromos, near Chillan, Chile, to an expansion of the vision of health evangelism far and wide, including the establishment of 2 health evangelism schools, several wellness centers, and MANY health expos, cooking classes, multiple month-long health evangelism trainings, and much more. It is an inspiration to see many churches and church members working across the country to hasten the coming of Jesus through health evangelism!
