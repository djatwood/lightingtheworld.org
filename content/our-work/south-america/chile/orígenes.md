Situated along the coastal area of central Chile and only an hour away from the capital, Orígenes HLC has a great view of the ocean and a cool breeze to try to keep the summer heat at bay. Orígenes HLC started with one small house, which they soon converted into a larger building that could accommodate their various activities. From retreats to wellness programs as well as 1 month training programs, Orígenes HLC is doing much to spread the light of health evangelism in Chile.

## What Orígenes HLC is doing

Los Orígenes began with organizing various activities such as health fairs, health retreats, and youth programs since 2014. In January of 2015, they offered their first one month LIGHT course. The results were so positive that they decided to do another one the following year, 2016, as well as 5 & 10 day wellness programs. They also have plans to begin a 6 month program in the near future.
