God has worked several miracles to make a dream into a reality and become what it is today. God brought a visionary leader, ilse Wandersleben, back from the US to Chile, and a dedicated team have joined her, whom have worked tirelessly to start a training school and a lifestyle center. The vision became clearer after visiting several training schools and lifestyle centers in the US, Ukraine, and Colombia. The team began conducting weekend and two day programs, cooking classes, and health talks.

In January 2014, LIGHT was invited to conduct their first 1-month Health Essentials training at Los Aromos, and during this time, plans were finalized to begin a six month health evangelism program. LIGHT has been working to support the Los Aromos staff, as well as several other families that have caught the vision and are currently working towards building lifestyle centers and/or health evangelism schools in multiple locations around Chile.

Many acacia trees thrive on the property, and in Spanish, the word for acacia is Los Aromos, thus lending its name to the project. Ample, fertile agricultural lands supply opportunities for feeding the students and staff.

## What Los Aromos is doing

Los Aromos conducts health seminars throughout Chile, usually at churches. Topics often include nutrition, hydrotherapy, massage, natural remedies, health expos, the use of charcoal and clay, prevention of common diseases, how to deal with stress and depression, and much more.

On the 18th of August, 2014, Los Aromos started their first 6 month health evangelism course with 7 precious students.

Los Aromos in partnership with LIGHT is continuing to offer further 1 month health evangelism courses.

In May, 2015 Los Aromos began receiving their first guests at their lifestyle center. It has been a joy to see how God has been blessing and touching lives with healing.
