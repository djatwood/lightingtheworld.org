## Overview

Peru Projects supports and directs the Bible workers in remote regions of the Peruvian Amazon basin (more than 200,000 square miles of jungle) and operates a mission aviation program to support the Bible work and provide much needed emergency and civic aid flights.  To provide further help to the peoples of the jungle and further the Gospel work, the leadership at Peru Projects are seeking to establish a permanent health evangelism training school in collaboration with LIGHT.  Interest is high, property is available, but teachers and funds are needed to make it a reality.

LIGHT has had the privilege to collaborate with Peru Projects on several health evangelism trainings. In 2010, we conducted a 2 1/2 week intensive LIGHT training for 88 church planters, Bible workers and church leaders working in the Peruvian rainforest region. The response of the attendees was tremendous, with many stating that they were both inspired and equipped to more effectively return to their work for the Lord and their local churches to help hasten the Lord’s coming.

## What’s Happening Now

In 2015 LIGHT returned to conduct a second one month Essentials LIGHT school on the Peru Projects campus. Then in March, LIGHT partnered with Peru Projects to begin a 9 month health evangelism training specially designed to prepare church planters for the Peruvian rainforest region.
