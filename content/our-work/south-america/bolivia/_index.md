## Overview

Over the past few years, LIGHT has had the privilege to partner with Instituto Quebrada León located in Bolivia to conduct over 15 one-month health evangelism training programs across the country of Bolivia. On a more permanent level, LIGHT has affiliated with Instituto Quebrada León (IQL), based near Santa Cruz, to support their 9-month health evangelism training course in Spanish, and now their 9-month advanced health evangelism training.

## What Instituto Quebrada León (IQL) is doing

IQL opened as a health evangelism school in 2011 by Dr. Dosung Kim and his wife Anita and their three sons. The 413-acre property is located out in the country near to Santa Cruz, Bolivia, and through many miracles and sacrifice God has helped the jungle to be transformed into a vibrant center of education and ministry to the surrounding regions with dormitories, a classroom and kitchen, and staff housing. More than five, 9-month health evangelism training programs have been conducted, with approximately 30 graduates in recent years. In addition, rooms have been made available for starting a small wellness center, with plans to build a wellness center in the near future. The teachers and students are very actively involved in ministry to many neighboring communities, regularly helping in 9 different locations on Saturdays as of 2015.

IQL offers an advanced course which helps to equip persons to help run small lifestyle centers and prepare for leadership in health evangelism settings.

IQL has plans to start a new project called the “Apostle Paul” project. This involves working together with the church in strategically placing graduates into a village or community as health evangelists for a period of a year or so. The idea is to establish a church and train the members in order for it to continue functioning after the group leaves, very similar to the way Paul traveled and established churches in the days of the early apostolic church. The Apostle Paul project will be launched in 2016 with the first group of “Apostle Pauls”.

## Get Involved

**Financial:** Sponsorship to help send graduates to do one month LIGHT health evangelism programs around the country of Bolivia. Estimated cost to sponsor a 1 month school: $500. Also, student sponsorship would be most helpful at $100/month for worthy students.
