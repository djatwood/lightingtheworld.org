Amazon Lifesavers is a boat launch project striving to reach the unreached people groups throughout the Amazon River basin. It was formerly organized in 2007 while reviving a long time mission of the SDA church called the Luzeiro Project. Amazon Lifesavers has over five boats working the river delivering supplies, offering medical/dental help, supporting bible workers, beginning new church groups and more!

In recent years LIGHT has been partnering with Amazon Lifesavers to prepare Bible workers to effectively carry the message of God’s love and better health to the Amazon basin. There have been many graduates that have been successfully placed in villages along the Amazon River as health evangelists. In 2015 Amazon Lifesavers dedicated a spacious and attractive new school building on their campus to more effectively help in the preparation of missionaries.
