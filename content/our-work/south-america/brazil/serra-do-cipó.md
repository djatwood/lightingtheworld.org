## What we’re doing

Serra do Cipó Lifestyle Center became a LIGHT affiliate in 2015, and in July began their first 1 month course. A few months afterward, they started accepting patients into their lifestyle program.

The Associação Bem Estar Natural Sênior was founded in 2014. With the vast territory and diverse people groups that Brazil has to offer, LIGHT was glad for the opportunity to affiliate with Serra do Cipó, bringing more training opportunities to this country.
