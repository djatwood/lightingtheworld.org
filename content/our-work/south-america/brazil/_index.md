## Overview

LIGHT’s work first entered Brazil back in 2008 when after conducting several one-month courses we sent a team from Wildwood Lifestyle Center to begin a six-month school outside of Rio de Janeiro. Since then we have run several schools in Parana, Sao Paulo, Ceara, Mina Gerais and the Amazon.

Our LIGHT affiliate schools include: Amazon Lifesavers, Silvestre Hospital, VIVA – Espaço Educativo de Saúde, and Serra do Cipó Lifestyle Center
