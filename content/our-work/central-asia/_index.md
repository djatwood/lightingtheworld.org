The global population of Christianity is at about 2.18 billion adherents. 36.8 percent reside in the Americas; 25.9% are in Europe; 23.6% live in Sub-Saharan Africa; Middle East and North Africa have 0.6%.  Asia and the pacific have 13.1 percent of the worldwide Christian population.

It’s astounding.

The region where Christianity had it’s beginnings is today the place with the lowest concentration of believers. In its place, Islam has sprung up. About 20% of the world’s Muslim population can be found in Central Asia. A low Christian population is not the only challenging factor for this region. Religious persecution is a growing problem.

Religious persecution has increased by 400 percent over the last ten years throughout the 10/40 window. Hostility is at an all time high. In many of these countries proselytizing is a crime punishable by death.

How then is evangelism possible?

Ellen White says, “As religious aggression subverts the liberties of our nation, those who would stand for freedom of conscience will be placed in unfavorable positions. For their own sake, they should, while they have opportunity, become intelligent in regard to disease, its causes, prevention, and cure. And those who do this will find a field of labor anywhere. There will be suffering ones, plenty of them, who will need help, not only among those of our own faith, but largely among those who know not the truth”
