## Overview

Over the past several decades India is becoming more industrialized, which brings blessings and curses. While there has been an increase in the economy there has unfortunately been an increase in chronic diseases such as heart disease and diabetes. A young couple pioneered medical missionary work over 40 years ago and it has been steadily growing since then. In 1997 Pastor John came to Wildwood and was so impressed with the course he decided to take it back to his home country. Since then the team at Jeeva Jothi have offered a Christ-centered curriculum with a foundation in health evangelism and emphasizing the importance of useful manual labor.

In 2010 LIGHT organized several programs throughout the country to spread the Good News to the people there. As a results hundreds received training and many people caught a vision for reaching the precious people of this great country using the Master’s method.
