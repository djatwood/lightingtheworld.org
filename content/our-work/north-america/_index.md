The North American region is known for many things worldwide, but to Seventh-day Adventists it holds a special importance. This was the region in which the Adventist church was born. It was here that the Adventist message took its roots and developed into a global body of believers.

Recent statistics show that in the United States the church is growing at a faster rate than any other denomination.
