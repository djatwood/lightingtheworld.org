## Overview

The work of LIGHT had its start indirectly in the USA. As we consider the global field of Medical Missionary Training Courses most of the have been influenced in one way or another by the Wildwood Center of Health Evangelism. From this institution, many other institutions took courage, counsel, and even financial support to get started. The idea for an abridgment of the current six-month school model to a one-month model came from a review of the curriculum of several schools modeled after Wildwood. Throughout the years there have been many successful schools run in the USA with many successful graduates that go overseas or even work in their own communities. Two such schools are Uchee Pines: Lifestyle Educator Course and the Wildwood Center of Health Evangelism: Health Evangelism Course.  We have even partnered with the Lay Institute for Evangelism, better know as LIFE. Recently we have affiliated with Eden Valley’s new six-month training school called The Well. But to answer the call of God (every member of the church, should take hold of MMW), we have developed shorter courses that can be done in either 3,7 or 10 days. We have also worked on developing online courses for anyone globally with an internet connection to be trained as a Medical Missionary.

## What We Are Doing

We are beginning to partner with several church leaders throughout the North America Division to conduct short-term health evangelism training courses. These courses are designed to equip the local church with the tools it needs to begin successful, sustainable, and comprehensive health evangelism in their community culminating with many being reached for Jesus. We are seeking work in cooperation with the General Conference’s main thrust of City Evangelism starting in New York City in June-August in 2013. Please pray for the other large cities of the United States and our involvement with the evangelistic efforts throughout this great country.
