From the very beginning, our philosophy at Wildwood has been to reach people where they are individually and to minister to them on all levels, physically, mentally, and spiritually. For this reason we present a “heavenly lifestyle”, teaching practical principles of living along with natural remedies, inspiring confidence in a Creator who has designed a plan for each life, and desiring the learners to embrace divine instruction.

The Wildwood Center for Health Evangelism exists to train medical missionaries to comprehensively give the gospel to the world in this generation and thus hasten the second coming of our Lord. We strive to provide an environment that promotes spiritual and intellectual growth and training that both encourages and challenges our students to give their best to the Master.

## What Wildwood Is Doing
 
The Lord is looking for dedicated, mission-minded individuals of all ages who are willing to commit themselves to spreading His end-time message, especially through the right-arm of health evangelism. It is our desire to fulfill this commission.

It is our endeavor that each student, teacher, and worker at Wildwood Center for Health Evangelism will not only be equipped but also empowered to “shine as lights in the world, holding forth the Word of Life” as together we seek to hasten the coming of our Lord.
