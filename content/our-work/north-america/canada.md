## Overview

Fountain View Academy has been striving to provide a unique education experience for young people ever since it’s commencement in 1975. Following the pattern outlined in the book “Education” by Ellen G. White, they have been providing their students with both vocational and academic work to provide their students with a more balanced education. Fountain View Academy strives to give their students a good foundation for success in life, but most importantly, a foundation that will give them a life that will last for eternity.

## What We Are Doing

As Fountain View Academy continues to look for good programs to incorporate into their curriculum and opportunities for their graduates upon completing their studies there, Fountain View Academy and Lay Institute for Global Health Training have decided to partner together in order to provide the Essentials of Health Evangelism certificate course to their students. This partnership gives the students a broader spectrum of options to choose from whether they continue their training at one of LIGHT’s affiliate schools or apply to serve in the mission field upon graduating from Fountain View, they now have the opportunities the Essentials Certificate affords.
