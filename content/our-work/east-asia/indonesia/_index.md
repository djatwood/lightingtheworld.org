## Overview

Indonesia has the largest Islamic population in the world, and it is basically new to medical missionary work, even though there are several lifestyle centers that have been established here before.  There have been several 2-3 week trainings conducted from 2005 until 2009, which have served as an introduction to medical missionary work; but it was not until October of 2010 that an official 1-month training was conducted.  This started a chain of events that led to the establishment of Healing Way Indonesia Medical Missionary Training School, an affiliate of LIGHT, which is now located in Purwodadi, East Java.

From January until June 2012, Healing Way Indonesia held its first 6-month training school, and the graduates are now working in several fields all over the country for one year.

## What We Are Doing

We are now teaching the second session of the 6-month training, and at the same time we are promoting and teaching the 1-month training in several locations for the purpose of training church members who cannot come to the 6-month program. We also conduct weekend Health & Family Camp programs. We are planning to make the future 6-month programs geared toward training qualified teachers to help us conduct more classes for church members.

We are also blessed with a small lifestyle center that has operated under Healing Way Indonesia since August of 2012. It is a place where the students can have practical training in helping others.

We are planning to start a Mobile Healthy Lifestyle Clinic project, where we can be more mobile in serving the Islamic communities in many islands and provinces around the country.

## Get Invovled

Prayer. Please pray with us that God will impress more and more Indonesian people, young and old, to get involved in this last great work before Jesus comes. Also, pray for the Healing Way Indonesia team of volunteers that we will be strengthened to depend on God and be faithful in His work.

Financial. You can help us financially for the Mobile Healthy Lifestyle Clinic program to become a reality. We are in need of a small modified bus, costing around $45,000, that we can use to take our services to the people. Please type Indonesia Mobile Healthy Lifestyle Clinic in the Paypal note for this program. Also, we need financial support for the trainers that have and will come from the Philippines and the United States. This is a total of about $12,000 for immigration papers and cost of living for one year. Please type Indonesia Trainers in the Paypal note for this.
