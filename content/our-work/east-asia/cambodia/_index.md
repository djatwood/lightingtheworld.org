## Overview

Cambodia is mainly a Buddhist country. With traditions and superstitions still being a stronghold, Christianity is surviving. In fact, Seventh – day Adventist is growing. The population’s birth rate and death rate is high, life expectancy is quite low as a result of HIV. That’s why the common ministry in Cambodia is orphanage even by other foreign denominations. The need of medical missionary work is really obvious. If MM work would restore the body and lead them to live a healthier life, it would open a way for the Khmer people to trust God more than traditions and superstition.

In Year 2011-2012, 15 young people were trained for this work. They were also trained to be teachers since that’s the easy way to enter the villages. Part of their health talk was to go to the village and held health lectures about hydrotherapy, herbs, basic nutrition and hygiene. Their graduation theme was “Light in the Darkness” and some of them are continuing their training on evangelism.

## What We Are Doing

LIGHT has been involved in the work in Cambodia by affiliating with Salt Ministries at Wat Preah Yesu (Jesus’ Temple). A place where there is an orphanage, 12-K school with dormitories for students from other provinces, and a multi- media studio. Aside from English, music, and language, 11th and 12th grades are different from other grades. The 6- month LIGHT course is included in their 2- year curriculum. It was expanded with teacher’s training, multi- media training, mechanics, and hospitality. The objective is to produce medical missionary teachers, medical missionary evangelists, and medical missionary mechanics, etc. who can be self-supporting in their mission field. Currently on third week of this new program in Wat Preah Yesu, the 18 students are quite interested with what they are learning and will be learning. Included in their curriculum is 2- week community evangelism/canvassing every after school year.
