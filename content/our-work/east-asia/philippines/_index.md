## Overview

In 1996, Wildwood Lifestyle Center & Hospital sent a medical missionary couple to conduct training courses in the Philippines. At first, they ran a 3-month course followed by a 1-month course. Two years later, they helped establish the Better Way Foundation. Many miracles happened along the way. In 2006, the Better Way Foundation acquired a beautiful 17 hectare (about 40 acres) property in the foothills of Nueva Era, Ilocos Norte located in northern Philippines. In 2008, LIGHT teachers came and started a six-month training program.  At the present time, we are on the 8th session of this course. Also, we have conducted over 30 1-month training programs in the past four years all over the country.

## What We Are Doing

The Better Way Foundation’s (BWF) goal is to be a self-supporting institution which promotes healthy lifestyle through producing wholesome food products (bread, soy milk, granola, etc.). Part of the 17 hectares of land that the foundation owns is being cultivated for organic farming. In the past few years the BWF has acquired two more properties. Also, we have established bakeries in different locations around the Philippines. These places have become outposts for our graduates. Graduates from the LIGHT training programs work hand in hand with the Seventh-day Adventist leadership. LIGHT provides a team to do ground preparation whenever there is an evangelistic crusade in different areas in the country. Graduates are also sent to different fields to educate church members and the community in aspects of healthful living. Since LIGHT is part of ASI, BWF’s graduates give regular health lectures to the ASI attendees at their annual meetings. They conduct Health Expos and staff the different business outposts of the BWF. LIGHT also assists the different supporting organizations of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. (Philippine Frontier Missions, 1000 Missionary Movement and Sulads) Through the years God has been continually blessing the Better Way Foundation and LIGHT Philippines.

## Get Involved

1. Please pray for the plans to open an outpost in three union territories around the country. We have been blessed with two lands for work in the northern and central part of the Philippines. We need to construct a bakery and a room for volunteer workers to begin the work there.

2. We are about to start constructing a lifestyle center at the same place where the 6-month course is regularly held. Please pray for this project to be finished and for the means to be provided.

3. We have a team who is willing to visit you and conduct a Health Expo and a one-month medical missionary training.

4. Be a student in our 6-month course at Nueva Era, Ilocos Norte, Philippines.
