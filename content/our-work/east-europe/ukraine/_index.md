## Overview

In the early 2000’s Wildwood Lifestyle Center & Hospital helped to establish and form a partnership with a new Lifestyle Center and medical missionary training school in the Ukraine called “Our Home”. Over the past decade this ministry has blossomed to be a leader in preventive medicine throughout Eastern Europe while ministering to over 6,000  patients! Each lifestyle session is packed with over 50 patients keeping the staff very busy and offering lots of training opportunities for students.

## What We’re Doing

The school offers introductory one-month and complete six-month LIGHT courses. Through this instruction, the team has helped more than 1,600 lay people to gain a vision for ministry. No other LIGHT school in the world has trained so many medical missionaries as “Our Home”! The training is done both on the institution’s campus and through field schools in different parts of Ukraine, Russia, and Belarus. The medical missionary training program was welcomed by the Church in 2006, and now it is a part of the medical missionary program in the Ukraine Union of Seventh-day Adventist Churches. The project’s goal is to train lay people for medical missionary service inside the church and also for outside work in their communities. The program also calls for lay people to start new institutions like health centers, treatment rooms, and health food stores.

One of the leading staff members at “Our Home” is also LIGHT’s Eastern Europe Regional Director, Alexey Ostapenco. Much through his leadership, “Our Home” as helped establish other medical missionary centers throughout Ukraine and Russia.
